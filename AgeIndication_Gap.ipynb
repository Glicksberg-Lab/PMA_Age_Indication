      "MiniMed 670G SystemThe Medtronic MiniMed 670G system is intended for continuous delivery of basal insulin (at user selectable rates) and administration of insulin boluses (in user selectable amounts) for the management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons, fourteen years of age and older, requiring insulin as well as for the continuous monitoring and trending of glucose levels in the fluid under the skin. The MiniMed 670G System includes SmartGuard technology, which can be programmed to automatically adjust delivery of basal insulin based on Continuous Glucose Monitor sensor glucose values, and can suspend delivery of insulin when the sensor glucose value falls below or is predicted to fall below predefined threshold values.The Medtronic MiniMed 670G System consists of the following devices: MiniMed 670G insulin pump, the Guardian Link (3) Transmitter, the Guardian Sensor (3), One-Press Serter, and the Contour NEXT Link 2.4 Glucose Meter. The system requires a prescription.The Guardian Sensor (3) glucose values are not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a finger stick may be required. All therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor and not on values provided by the Guardian Sensor (3).Guardian Sensor (3)The Guardian Sensor (3) is intended for use with the MiniMed 670G system to continuously monitor glucose levels in persons with diabetes. It is intended to be used for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons aged fourteen years and older, and to be used by the MiniMed 670G system to automatically adjust basal insulin levels. It is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard blood glucose monitoring devices. The sensor is intended for single use and requires a prescription. The Guardian Sensor (3) is indicated for 7 days of continuous use.One-press SerterThe One-press Serter is used as an aid for inserting the sensor. It is indicated for single-patient use and it is not intended for multiple-patient use.Guardian Link (3) Transmitter The Guardian Link (3) Transmitter is intended for use with the MiniMed 670G System. The Guardian Link (3) Transmitter powers the glucose sensor, collects and calculates sensor data, and wirelessly sends the data to the MiniMed 670G insulin pump. The Transmitter is intended for single-patient multi-use. Contour NEXT Link 2.4 Glucose MeterThe Contour Next Link 2.4 Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an over the counter (OTC) device utilized by persons with diabetes in home settings for the measurement of glucose in whole blood, and is for single patient use only and should not be shared. The Contour Next Link 2.4 wireless blood glucose monitoring system is indicated for use with fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip and palm only. The Contour NEXT Test Strips are intended for self-testing by persons with diabetes for the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood samples from 20 to 600 mg/dL. The Contour Next Link 2.4 wireless blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used to transmit glucose values to the MiniMed 670G pump and facilitate transfer of information to Medtronic CareLink Software through the use of radio frequency communication. The Contour Next Link 2.4 Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of, or screening for, diabetes mellitus. It is not intended for use on neonates.\n",

      "Approval for the Dexcom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Dexcom G5) is a glucose monitoring system indicated for the management of diabetes in persons age 2 years and older. The Dexcom G5 is designed to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions. Interpretation of the Dexcom G5 results should be based on the glucose trends and several sequential readings over time. The Dexcom G5 also aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. The Dexcom G5 is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.The G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System consists of the following devices: sensor, transmitter (with onboard algorithm), receiver, and mobile app. The sensor is a small flexible metal filament that is inserted into subcutaneous tissue where it enzymatically generates electrical current in response to the presence of glucose. The transmitter is connected to the sensor and is worn on the surface of the body. It samples the electrical current produced by the sensor and converts these measurements into glucose readings using an onboard algorithm. The transmitter sends glucose data to both the receiver and the mobile app and receives blood glucose calibration and other user inputs from these display devices. The receiver displays the current glucose reading (updated every 5 minutes) and glucose trends (up to 24 hours) from the transmitter. The receiver alerts the patient when glucose levels are outside of a target zone (factory set at 55 mg/dL, in addition to up to two user defined limits), when it is time to enter a blood glucose value from a fingerstick to calibrate the system, and for other important system conditions. The mobile app provides an alternative user interface to the receiver for those users with a compatible Apple iOS device. It provides similar glucose display, alert, and calibration functionality to the receiver and additionally provides connectivity to the Dexcom Share service.\n",

THE NUCLEUS® HYBRID L24 COCHLEAR IMPLANT SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC STIMULATION TO THE MID-TO-HIGH FREQUENCY REGION OF THE COCHLEA AND ACOUSTIC AMPLIFICATION TO THE LOW FREQUENCY REGIONS, FOR PATIENTS WITH RESIDUAL LOW FREQUENCY HEARING SENSITIVITY.  THE SYSTEM IS INDICATED FOR UNILATERAL USE IN PATIENTS AGED 18 YEARS AND OLDER WHO HAVE RESIDUALLOW-FREQUENCY HEARING SENSITIVITY AND SEVERE TO PROFOUND HIGH FREQUENCY SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS, AND WHO OBTAIN LIMITED BENEFIT FROM APPROPRIATELY FIT BILATERAL HEARING AIDS. TYPICAL PREOPERATIVE HEARING OF CANDIDATES RANGES FROM NORMAL TO MODERATE HEARING LOSS IN THE LOW FREQUENCIES (THRESHOLDS NO POORER THAN 60 DB HL UP TO AND INCLUDING 500 HZ), WITH SEVERE TO PROFOUND MID TO HIGH FREQUENCY HEARING LOSS (THRESHOLD AVERAGE OF 2000, 3000, AND 4000 HZ >=75 DB HL) IN THE EAR TO BE IMPLANTED, AND MODERATELY SEVERE TO PROFOUND MID TO HIGH FREQUENCY HEARING LOSS (THRESHOLD AVERAGE OF 2000, 3000, AND 4000 HZ >=60 DB HL) IN THE CONTRALATERAL EAR.  THE CNC WORD RECOGNITION SCORE WILL BE BETWEEN 10% AND 60%, INCLUSIVELY, IN THE EAR TO BE IMPLANTED IN THE PREOPERATIVE AIDED CONDITION AND IN THE CONTRALATERAL EAR WILL BE EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN THAT OF THE EAR TO BE IMPLANTED BUT NOT MORE THAN 80% CORRECT.

The MED-EL EAS System is indicated for partially deaf individuals aged 18 years and older who have residual hearing sensitivity in the low frequencies sloping to a severe/profound sensorineural hearing loss in the mid to high frequencies, and who obtain minimal benefit from conventional acoustic amplification. Typical preoperative hearing of candidates ranges from normal hearing to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies (thresholds no poorer than 65 dB HL up to and including 500 Hz) with severe to profound mid- to high-frequency hearing loss (no better than 70 dB HL at 2000 Hz and above) in the ear to be implanted.  For the non-implanted ear, thresholds may be worse than the criteria for the implanted ear, but may not be better.  The CNC word recognition score in quiet in the best-aided condition will be 60% or less, in the ear to be implanted and in the contralateral ear. Prospective candidates should go through a suitable hearing aid trial, unless already appropriately fit with hearing aids.',\n",
