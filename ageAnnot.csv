The transmitter sends glucose data to both the receiver and the mobile app and receives blood glucose calibration and other user inputs from these display devices. The receiver displays the current glucose reading (updated every 5 minutes) and glucose trends (up to 24 hours) from the transmitter. The receiver alerts the patient when glucose levels are outside of a target zone (factory set at 55 mg/dL, in addition to up to two user defined limits), when it is time to enter a blood glucose value from a fingerstick to calibrate the system, and for other important system conditions. The mobile app provides an alternative user interface to the receiver for those users with a compatible Apple iOS device. It provides similar glucose display, alert, and calibration functionality to the receiver and additionally provides connectivity to the Dexcom Share servi",T1,170-187,age_range,denotes,2 and older,P120005,S041

The Guardian Sensor (3) glucose values are not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a finger stick may be required. All therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor and not on values provided by the Guardian Sensor (3).Guardian Sensor (3)The Guardian Sensor (3) is intended for use with the MiniMed 670G system to continuously monitor glucose levels in persons with diabetes. It is intended to be used for detecting trends and tracking patterns, and to be used by the MiniMed 670G system to automatically adjust basal insulin levels. It is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard blood glucose monitoring devices. The sensor is intended for single use and requires a prescription. The Guardian Sensor (3) is indicated for 7 days of continuous use. One-press Serter The One-press serter is used as an aid for inserting the sensor. It is indicated for single-patient use and it is not intended for multiple-patient use. Guardian Link (3) Transmitter The Guardian Link (3) Transmitter is intended for use with the MiniMed 670G System. The Guardian Link (3) Transmitter powers the glucose sensor, collects and calculates sensor data, and wirelessly sends the data to the MiniMed 670G insulin pump. The Transmitter is intended for single-patient multi-use. Contour NEXT Link 2.4 Glucose MeterThe Contour Next Link 2.4 Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an over the counter (OTC) device utilized by persons with diabetes in home settings for the measurement of glucose in whole blood, and is for single patient use only and should not be shared. The Contour Next Link 2.4 wireless blood glucose monitoring system is indicated for use with fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertip and palm only. The Contour NEXT Test Strips are intended for self-testing by persons with diabetes for the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood samples from 20 to 600 mg/dL. The Contour Next Link 2.4 wireless blood glucose monitoring system is intended to be used to transmit glucose values to the MiniMed 670G pump and facilitate transfer of information to Medtronic CareLink Software through the use of radio frequency communication. The Contour Next Link 2.4 Wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended for the diagnosis of, or screening for, diabetes mellitus.

The output is also expressed as a t-score and a z-score, and can be used in conjunction with other clinical risk factors as an aid to the physician in the diagnosis of osteoporosis and other medical conditions leading to reduced bone strength and, ultimately , in the determination of fracture risk.  Multiple skeletal site testing provides clinicians with alternatives if one site is not accessible and with additional skeletal information (i. e., from bones with different combinations of cortical and cancellous material and from weight bearing and non-weight bearing sites) that assists in diagnosing osteoporosis and risk fracture.  The sos measurement by omnisense has a precision error low enough in comparison with the expected annual change in a patient's measurement to make it suitable for monitoring bone changes which occur in the early years following menopause (i. e., age range approximately 50-65 years",T1,1439-1450,age_range,denotes,50-65 years,P990035,S001

The Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM is designed to replace fingerstick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions.  The t: slim X2 System aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these excursions.  Interpretation of the t: slim X2 System results should be based on the trends and patterns seen with several sequential readings over time.  The t: slim X2 System is indicated for use in individuals 6 years of age and greater.  The t: slim X2 System is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

The device is intended to provide the opportunity to detect and recognize auditory information through electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve for server to profoundly hearing-impaired individuals who obtain little or no benefit from conventional acoustic amplification in the best-aided condition.  The combi 40+ is indicated for the following patient populations:  adults of eighteen (18) years of age or older who have bilateral, sensorineural hearing impairment and obtain limited benefit from appropriately fitted binaural hearing aids.  These individuals typically demonstrate bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss determined by a pure tone average of 70 db or greater at 500 hz, 1000 hz, and 2000 hz.  Limited benefit from amplification is defined by test scores of 40% correct or less in best-aided listening condition on cd recorded tests of open-set sentence recognition hearing in noise test (hint) sentences.  Children aged eighteen (18) months to seventeen (17) years eleven (11) months must demonstrate a profound, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with thresholds of 90 db or greater at 1000hz.  In younger children, little or no benefit is defined by lack of progress in the development of simple auditory skills in conjunction with appropriate amplification and participation in intensive aural habilitation over a three (3) to six (6) month period.  In older children, lack of aided benefit is defined as < 20% correct on the multi-syllabic lexical neighborhood test (mlnt) or lexical neighborhood test (lnt), depending upon the child's cognitive ability and linguistic skills.

The device is intended to provide the opportunity to detect and recognize auditory information through electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve for server to profoundly hearing-impaired individuals who obtain little or no benefit from conventional acoustic amplification in the best-aided condition.  The combi 40+ is indicated for the following patient populations:  adults of eighteen (18) years of age or older who have bilateral, sensorineural hearing impairment and obtain limited benefit from appropriately fitted binaural hearing aids.  These individuals typically demonstrate bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss determined by a pure tone average of 70 db or greater at 500 hz, 1000 hz, and 2000 hz.  Limited benefit from amplification is defined by test scores of 40% correct or less in best-aided listening condition on cd recorded tests of open-set sentence recognition hearing in noise test (hint) sentences.  Children aged eighteen (18) months to seventeen (17) years eleven (11) months must demonstrate a profound, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with thresholds of 90 db or greater at 1000hz.  In younger children, little or no benefit is defined by lack of progress in the development of simple auditory skills in conjunction with appropriate amplification and participation in intensive aural habilitation over a three (3) to six (6) month period.  In older children, lack of aided benefit is defined as < 20% correct on the multi-syllabic lexical neighborhood test (mlnt) or lexical neighborhood test (lnt), depending upon the child's cognitive ability and linguistic skills.  A three (3) to six (6) month hearing aid trial is required for children without previous experience with hearing aids.
