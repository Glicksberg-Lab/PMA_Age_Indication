Approval for the following changes: 1) detection technology from spectrophotometry to chemiluminesence2) appropriate reagent process changes to accommodate chemiluminesence detection3) usage on the dimension vista 1500 system4) usage on the dimension vista 3000t system which consists of two dimension vista1500 systems connected by a sample track transport mechanism5) usage on the dimension vista 1500 system connected to the streamlab analyticalworkcell laboratory automation system6) the new dimension vista psa calibrator for use with the dimension vista tpsa and fpsa methods. the device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name dimension vista tpsa flexreagent cartridge and is indicated for the following uses: the tpsa method is an in vitro diagnostic test for the quantitative measurement of total prostatespecific antigen (psa) in human serum and plasma on the dimension vista system: 1) as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer when used in conjunction with digital rectal exam (dre) in men 50 years or older. prostate biopsy is required for diagnosis of cancer. 2) as an aid in themanagement (monitoring) of prostate cancer patients. the dimension vista psa calibrator will be marketed separately for use with the dimensionvista tpsa flex reagent and is indicated for the calibration of total (tpsa) and free (fpsa) prostate specific antigen methods on the dimension vista systems.
