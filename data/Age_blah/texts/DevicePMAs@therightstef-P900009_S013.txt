Approval for the low intensity ultrasound fracture treatment system-sonic accelerated fracture healing system (safhs(r)).  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name exogen 2000+(tm) sonic accelerated fracture healing system (safhs(r)) and is indicated for the non-invasive treatment of estblished nonunions* exluding skull and vertebra.  In addition, the exogen 2000+(tm) or sonic accelerated fracture healing system (safhs(r)) is indicated for accelerating the time to a healed fracture for fresh, closed, posteriorly displaced distal radius fractures and fresh, closed or grade 1 open tibial diaphysis in skeletally mature individuals when these fractures are orthopedically managed by closed reduction and cast immobilization.  * a nonunion is considered to be established when the fracture site shows no visibly progressive signs of healing.
