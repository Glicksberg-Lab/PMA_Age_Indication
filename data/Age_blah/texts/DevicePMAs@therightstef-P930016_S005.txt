Approval for the VISX Excimer Laser System (Models B and C).  This device is indicated for myopic and astigmatic PRK using an ablation zone with a 6.0 mm major axis.  The PRK procedure is intended for use:  1)in patients with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of less than or equal to 0.5D (in both cylinder and sphere components) per year for at least one year prior to the date of the pre-operative examination; and 2) in patients 18-20 years of age in PRK treatments for the reduction or elimination of myopia (nearsightedness) of less than or equal to -6.0 D spherical equivelent at the corneal plane with less than or equal to -1.0 D of astigmatism; or 3) in patients 21 years of age or older in PRK treatments for the reduction or elimination of myopia (nearsightedness) of between 0 and -12.0 D spherical myopia at the spectacle plane and up to -4.0 D of astigmatism.
