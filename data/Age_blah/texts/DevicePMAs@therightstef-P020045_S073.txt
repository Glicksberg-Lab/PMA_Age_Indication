Approval for the Freezor Xtra Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter, CryoConsole system, and related accessories.  The device is indicated for the cryoablation of the conducting tissues of the heart in the treatment of patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). The Freezor Xtra catheter is also intended for minimally invasive cardiac surgery procedures, including surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The Freezor Xtra catheter freezes the target tissue and blocks the electrical conduction by creating an inflammatory response or cryonecrosis.
