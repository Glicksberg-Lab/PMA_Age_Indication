Approval for new pacemaker models, symphony models 2550, and 2250 and ela rhapsody models 2530, 2510 and 2210.  The symphony and ela rhapsody pacemaker systems are indicated for:  1) rate adaptive pacing in patients who may benefit from increased pacing rates concurrent with increases in minute ventilation and/or activity.  2) the accepted patient conditions warranting chronic cardiac pacing which include, but are not restricted to: a) symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent second- or third-degree av block; b) symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block; c) symptomatic paroxysmal or transient sinus node dysfunctions with or without associated av conduction disorders: d) bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome to prevent symptomatic bradycardia or some forms of symptomatic tachyarrhythmias; e) vasovagal syndromes or hypersensitive carotid sinus syndromes.  In addition, the dual-chamber and atrial tracking modes (sympohony dr model 2550 and ela rhapsody dr models 2530 and 2510) are indicated for patitnes who may benefit from maintenance of av synchrony.  Dual-chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of conduction disorders that require restoration of both rate and av synchrony which include:  1) various degrees of av block to maintain the atrial contribution to cardiac output; and 2) vvi intolerance (e. g., pacemaker syndrome) in the presence of persistent sinus rhythm.
