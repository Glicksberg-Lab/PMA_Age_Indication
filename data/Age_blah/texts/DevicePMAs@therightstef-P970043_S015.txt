Approval for the ladarvision 4000 excimer laser system.  The device uses a 6.5 mm optical zone, a 9.00 mm ablation zone, is locked-out for treatments above -9.75 diopters (d) sphere, -5.00d cylinder, and -10.63d spherical equivalent (se), and is indicated for wavefront-guided laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (lasik):  1) for the reduction or elimination of myopic astigmatism up to -8.00d sphere with -0.50 to -4.00d cylinder and up to -8.00d se at the spectacle plane; 2) in patients who are 21 years of age or older; and 3) in patients with documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 months, as demonstrated by a change in sphere and cylinder of less than or equal to 0.50d for a se of up to -6.00d and less than or equal to 0.75d for a se greater than -6.00d.
