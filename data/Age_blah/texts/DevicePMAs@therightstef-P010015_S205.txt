Approval for the expansion of the indications for use of the crt-p and crt-d devices to include nyha functional class i, ii, or iii patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) => 50% are on stable, optimal heart failure medical therapy if indicated, and have atrioventricular block (av block) that is expected to require a high percentage of ventricular pacing that cannot be managed with algorithms to minimize right ventricular pacing.  These devices are indicated for the following:  the consulta crt-p system is indicated for: 1)  nyha functional class iii and iv patients who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal heart failure medical therapy and have a lvef =< 35%  and a prolonged qrs duration; and 2) nyha functional class i, ii, or iii patients who have a lvef  =<50% are on stable optimal heart failure medical therapy if indicated and have atrioventricular block (av block) that are expected to require a high percentage of ventricular pacing that cannot be managed with algorithms to minimize right ventricular pacing.
