Approval for the saber lumber i/f cage.  In addition, this supplement requested the approval of two new sizes, which will now be marketed as the jaguar lumbar i/f cage.  These devices are indicated for an open posterior approach using autogenous bone graft in patients with degenerative disc disease (ddd) at one or two spinal levels from l2-s1 whose condition requires the use of interbody fusion combined with posterolateral fusion (360 degrees fusion) and posterior pedicle screw fixation.  These patients may have had previous non-fusion spinal surgery at the involved spinal levels(s).  Ddd is defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies.
