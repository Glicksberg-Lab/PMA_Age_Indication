Approval for the following expanded device indications:  the s7 with discrete technology over-the-wire coronary stent system with the av 2000 balloon is indicated for: "improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo lesions (length <= 30 mm) in native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters ranting from 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm through direct stenting or predilatation.  Long-term outcome (beyond 180-days) for this permanent implant is unknown at present."  the s7 with discrete technology over-the-wire coronary stent system with the av100 balloon is indicated for:  "improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo lesions (length <= 30 mm) in native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters ranging from 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm through direct stenting or predilatation.  Long-term outcome (beyond 180 days) for this permanent implant is unknown at present."  the s7 with discrete technology rapid exchange coronary stent system with the av2000 balloon is indicated for:  "improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo lesions (length <= 30 mm) in native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters ranging from 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm through direct stenting predilatation.  Long-term outcome (beyond 180 days) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.  The rapid exchange delivery system will allow for perfusion at an average rate of 2 cc/min at nominal pressure during the 15-30 second stent deployment procedure only.  The rapid exchange stent delivery system is not intended for use as a stand-alone ptca perfusion catheter."  the s7 with discrete technology rapid exchange coronary stent system with the av100 balloon is indicated for: "improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo lesions (length <= mm) in...
