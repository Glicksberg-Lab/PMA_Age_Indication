Indicated for use as an adjunct for fracture stabilization in the treatment of low impact, unstable, metaphyseal distal radius fractures, in cases where early mobilization (cast for 2 weeks, then removable splint for 2-4 weeks) is indicated.  Use of SRS alone in highly comminuted fractures is not indicated.
