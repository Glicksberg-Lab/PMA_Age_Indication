Approval for the ladarvision 4000 excimer laser system.  This device uses a 6.5 mm optical zone, a 9.0 mm treatment zone, is locked-out for treatments above -7.0 diopters (d) as measured by manifest refraction, and is indicated for wavefront-guided laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (lasik):  1) for the reduction or elimination of myopia up to -7.00 d with less than -0.50 d of astigmatism at the spectacle plane;  2) in patients who are 21 years of age or older; and  3) in patients with documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 months, as demonstrated by a change of less than or equal to 0.50 d.
