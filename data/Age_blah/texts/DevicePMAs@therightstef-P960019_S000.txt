Device indicated for: 1)ptk in patients w/decreased best corrected visual acuity and/or with disabling pain that are the result of superficial corneal epithelial irregularities or stromal scars in the anterior one-third of the cornea. the patients must have failed w/alternative treatment options. for safety, the immediate postoperative corneal thickness must not be less than 250 microns. examples of those conditions that warrant ptk are: a) corneal scars & opacity (from trauma and inactive infections), b) dystrophies (reis-buckler's, granular and lattice), c) thygeson's superficial keratitis, d) irregular corneal surfaces associated w/filamentary keratitis and salzmann's nodular degeneration, e) residual band keratopathy after unsuccessful edta treatment, and, f) scars subsequent to previous (not concurrent) pterygium excision.  2)prk for a 6.0 ablation zone in patients who are myopic and meet all of the following criteria: 1)1.0 to 6.0 diopters (d) of myopia with astigmatism of 2.0 diopters; b) refractive change is within 0.5d for one year prior to the laser treatment; and c) 18 years of age or older.
