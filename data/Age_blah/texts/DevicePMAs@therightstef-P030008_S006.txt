Approval for increased pulse frequency from 400 to 500 hz, a new laser head, a new housing with greater integration of accessories, modified laser pulse temporal parameters, new eyetracker, new scanner, remodeled user interface, addition of networking capability, andmodified software. the device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name wavelight ex500 laser system and is indicated for laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik) for: 1) the reduction or elimination of myopia of up to -12.0 diopters (d) of sphere and up to - 6.0 d of astigmatism at the spectacle plane in patients who are 18 years of age or older with documentation of a stable manifest refraction defined as <= 0.50 d of preoperativespherical equivalent shift over one year prior to surgery; 2) the reduction or elimination of hyperopic refractive errors up to +6.0 d of sphere with and without astigmatic refractive errors up to 5.0 d at the spectacle plane, with a maximum manifest refraction spherical equivalent (mrse) of +6.0 d in patients who are 18 years of age or older with documentation of stable manifest refraction defined as<= 0.50 d of preoperative spherical equivalent shift over one year prior to surgery, exclusive of changes due to unmasking latent hyperopia; 3) the reduction or elimination of naturally occurring mixed astigmatism of up to 6.00 d at the spectacle plane in patients who are 21 years of age or older with documentation of a stable manifest refraction defined as  <= 0.50 d preoperative spherical equivalent shift over one year prior to surgery; and 4) the wavefront-guided (wfg) reduction or elimination of up to -7.00 d of spherical equivalent myopia or myopia with astigmatism, with up to -7.00 d of spherical component and up to 3.00 d of astigmatic component at the spectacle plane in patients who are 18 years of age or older with documentation of a stable manifest refraction defined as <= 0.50 d of preoperative spherical shift over one year prior to surgery.
