Approval for the therascreen egfr rgq pcr kit. this device is indicated for: the therascreen egfr rgq pcr kit is a real-time pcr test for the qualitative detection of exon 19 deletions and exon 21 (l858r) substitution mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) gene in dna derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) nonsmall cell lung cancer (nsclc) tumor tissue. the test is intended to be used to select patients with nsclc for whom gilotrjf (afatinib), an egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki), is indicated. safety and efficacy of gilotrif (afatinib) have not been established in patients whose tumors have l861q, g719x, 87681, exon 20 insertions, and t790m mutations, which are also detected by the therascreen egfr rgq pcr kit.  Specimens are processed using the qiaamp dsp dna ffpe tissue kit for manual sample preparation and the rotor-gene q mdx instrument for automated amplification anddetection.
