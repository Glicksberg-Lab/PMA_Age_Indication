Approval for the nidek ec-5000 excimer laser system.  The device uses a 6.0 mm optical zone and a 9.0 mm treatment zone and is indicated for laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (lasik):  1) for the reduction or elimination of hyperopia refractive errors from +0.5 to +5.0 d of sphere with or without astigmatic refractive errors from +0.5 to +2.0 d at the spectacle plane with manifest refraction spherical equivalent (mrse) of +5.0 d or less;  2) in patients 21 years of age or older; and  3) in patients with documented stability of manifest refraction over the prior year, demonstrated by a change in mrse not greater than +/- 0.50 diopter.
