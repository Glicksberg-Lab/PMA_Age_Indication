Approval for the medtronic ave bridge extra support over-the-wire (otw) renal stent system.  The device is indicated for use in patients with atherosclerotic disease of the renal arteries following sub-optimal or failed percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (ptra) of a de novo lesion (<=15 mm in length) located within 10 mm of the aortorenal border and with a reference vessel diameter of 5.0 to 7.0 mm.  Sub-optimal or failed ptra include any of the following:  visible evidence of a residual stenosis >=50% after optimal ptra, visible evidence of intimal dissection >6 mm, or peak systolic trans-stenotic gradient of >=20 mm hg or a mean of >=10 mm hg.
