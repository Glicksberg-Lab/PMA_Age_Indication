Approval for the formula balloon- expandable renal stent system.  This device is indicated for use in patients with atherosclerotic disease of the renal arteries following sub-optimal percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (ptra) of a de novo or restenotic lesion (<= 18 mm in length) located within 10 mm of the renal ostium and with a reference vessel diameter of 4.0 - 7.0 mm.  Supoptimal ptra is defined as >= 50% residual stenosis, >= 20 mmhg systolic or >= 10 mmhg mean translesional pressure gradient, or flow-limiting dissection.
