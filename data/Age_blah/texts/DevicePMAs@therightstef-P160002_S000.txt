Approval for the PD-L1(SP142) Assay. The device is indicated for the following:  VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 intended for use in the assessment of the PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) urothelial carcinoma tissue stained with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit and OptiView Amplifcation Kit on a VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument. PD-L1 status is determined by the proportion of tumor area occupied by PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity.  PD-L1 expression in >= 5% IC determined by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay in urothelial carcinoma tissue is associated with increased objective response rate (ORR) in a non-randomized study of TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab).
