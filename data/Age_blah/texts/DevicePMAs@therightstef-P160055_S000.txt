Approval for The Light Adjustable Lens and Light Delivery Device system is indicated for the reduction  residual astigmatism to improve uncorrected visual acuity after removal of the cataractous natural lens by phacoemulsification and implantation of the intraocular lens in the capsular bag, in adult patients:  1) With pre-existing corneal astigmatism of => 0.75 diopters; and 2) Without pre-existing macular disease.  The system also reduces the likelihood of clinically significant residual spherical refractive errors.
