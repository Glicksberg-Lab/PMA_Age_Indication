Approval for the visx star s2 and s3 excimer laser systems.  The devices are indicated for laser in-situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatments:  1) in patients with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of no more than 0.5 d (in both cylinder and sphere components) for at least one year prior to the date of pre-operative  examination; and  2) in patients 21 years of age or older in treatments for the reduction of elimination of naturally occurring hyperopia between +05 and +5.0 d sphere at the spectacle plane with or without refractive astigmatism up to +3.0 d, with a maximum manifest refraction spherical equivalent (mrse) of +6.0 d.
