Approval for the diasorin eti-ebk plus assay.  The device is indicated for the qualitative detection of hepatitis be antigen (hbeag) in human serum or plasma (edta, citrate or heparin).  The eti-ebk plus is intended for manual use and with the biochem immunosystems labotech/eti-lab automated instrument.  The detection of hbeag is indicative of active hbv replication, usually correlating with viremia.  A reactive test is presumptive laboratory evidence for infection with hepatitis b virus (hbv). further hbv serological marker testing is required to define the specific disease state.  The hbeag assay's performance has not been established for the monitoring of hbv disease or therapy.
