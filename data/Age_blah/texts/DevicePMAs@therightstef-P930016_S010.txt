These devices are indicated for photorefractive keratectomy (prk) treatments:  in patients with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of less than or equal to 0.5 d per year for at least one year prior to the date of pre-operative examination; andin patients 21 years of age or older for the reduction or elimination of naturally occurring hyperopia between +0.5 and + 5.0 d sphere at the spectacle plane with refractive astigmatism from +0.5 to +4.0 d with a maximum manifest refraction spherical equivalent (mrse) of +6.0 d.
