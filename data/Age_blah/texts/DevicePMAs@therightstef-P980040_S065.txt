Approval for the Tecnis Symfony Extended Range of Vision Intraocular Lens.  The TECNIS Symfony Extended Range of Vision IOL, Model ZXR00, is indicated for primary implantation for the visual correction of aphakia, in adult patients with less than 1 diopter of pre-existing corneal astigmatism, in whom a cataractous lens has been removed.  The lens mitigates the effects of presbyopia by providing an extended depth of focus.  Compared to an aspheric monofocal IOL, the lens provides improved intermediate and near visual acuity, while maintaining comparable distance visual acuity.  The Model ZXR00 IOL is intended for capsular bag placement only.  The TECNIS Symfony Toric Extended Range of Vision IOLs, Models ZXT150, ZXT225, ZXT300, and ZXT375, are indicated for primary implantation for the visual correction of aphakia and for reduction of residual refractive astigmatism in adult patients with greater than or equal to 1 diopter of preoperative corneal astigmatism, in whom a cataractous lens has been removed.  The lens mitigates the effects of presbyopia by providing an extended depth of focus. Compared to an aspheric monofocal IOL, the lens provides improved intermediate and near visual acuity, while maintaining comparable distance visual acuity.  The Model Series ZXT IOLs are intended for capsular bag placement only.
