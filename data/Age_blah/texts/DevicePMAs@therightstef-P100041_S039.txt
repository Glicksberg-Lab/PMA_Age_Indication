Approval for removal of access approach from device labeling. the device is indicated for patients with severe symptomatic calcified native aortic valve stenosis without severe aortic insufficiency and with ejection fraction > 20% who have been examined by a heart team including an experienced cardiac surgeon and a cardiologist and found to be: 1) inoperable and in whom existing co-morbidities would not preclude the expected benefit from correction of the aortic stenosis; or 2) be operative candidates for aortic valve replacement but who have a predicted operative risk score >= 8% or are judged by the heart team to be at a >= 15% risk of mortality for surgical aortic valve replacement.
