Approval for the ladarvision 4000 excimer laser system and the ladar 6000 excimer laser system.  These devices use a 6.5 mm optical zone and a 9.0 treatment zone and are indicated for wave-front guided customcornea laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (lasik): 1) for the reduction or elimination of mixed astigmatism 1.00 d to less than 5.00 d cycloplegic cylinder magnitude at the spectacle plane, which is greater than the sphere magnitude, and the cylinder and sphere have opposite signs; 2) in patients 21 years of age or older; and 3) in patients with documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 months, as demonstrated by a change in sphere and cylinder of less than or equal to 0.50 d.
