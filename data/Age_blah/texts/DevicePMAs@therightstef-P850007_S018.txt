Approval for modifications to the design and labeling of the physio-stim(r) bone growth stimulator.  The device, as modified, is to be marketed under the trade name physio-stim(r) lite and is indicated for the treatment of an established nonunion acquired secondary to trauma, excluding bertebrae and all flat bones, where the width of the nonunion defect is less than one-half the width of the bone to be treated.  A nonunion is considered to be established when a minimum of nine months has elapsed since injury and the fracture site shows no visibly progressive signs of helaing for a minimum of three months (no change in the fracture callus)
