Approval for the addition of the versant 440 molecular system (system 400).  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name versant hcv rna and is indicated for: the versant hcv rna 3.0 assay (bdna) is a signal amplification nucleic acid probe assay for the direct quantitation of human hepatitis c viral rna (hcv rna) in the serum or plasma of hcv infected individuals using the system 340 bdna analyzer or the versant 440 molecular system.  Specimens containing hcv genotypes 1-6 have been validated for quantitation in the assay.  The versant hcv rna 3.0 assay (bdna) is intended for use as an aid in the management of hcv-infected patients undergoing anti-viral therapy.  The assay measures hcv rna levels at baseline and during treatment and is useful in predicting non-sustained virological response to hcv therapy.  The results from the versant hcv rna 3.0 assay (bdna) must be interpreted within the context of all relevant clinical and laboratory findings.  Assay performance characteristics have been established only for individuals treated with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin.  No information is available on the assay?s predictive values when other therapies are used.
