Approval for the amplatzer muscular vsd occluder.  The device is indicated for use in patients with a complex ventricular septal defect (vsd) of significant size to warrant closure (large volume left to right shunt, pulmonary hypertension and/or clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure) who are considered to be at high risk for standard transatrial or transarterial surgical closure based on anatomical conditions and/or based on overall medical condition.  High risk anatomical factors for transatrial or transarterial surgical closure include patients: 1) requiring left ventriculotomy or an extensive right ventriculotomy; 2) with a failed previous vsd closure; 3) with multiple apical and/or anterior muscular vsds (?swiss cheese septum?); or 4) with posterior apical vsds covered by trabeculae.
