Approval for the star s4 ir excimer laser system and idesign advanced wavescan studio system. this device uses a 6.0 mm optical zone, and 8.0 mm treatment zone, and is indicated for wavefront-guided (wfg) laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik) in patients: 1) with myopia as measured by the idesign advanced wavescan studio system up to -11 d spherical equivalent with up to -5 d cylinder; and2) with agreement between manifest refraction (adjusted for optical infinity) and idesign advanced wavescan studio system refraction as follows: 1) spherical equivalent: magnitude of the difference is less than 0.625 d; and 2) cylinder: magnitude of the difference is less than or equal to 0.5 d; a) 18 years of age or older; and b) with refractive stability (a change of  1.0 d in sphere or cylinder for a minimum of 12 months prior to surgery).
