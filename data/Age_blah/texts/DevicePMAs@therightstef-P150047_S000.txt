Approval for the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 is a real-time PCR test for the qualitative detection of defined mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.  Defined EGFR mutations are detected using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPET) or circulating-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) from plasma derived from EDTA anti-coagulated peripheral whole blood. The test is indicated as a companion diagnostic to aid in selecting NSCLC patients for treatment with the targeted therapies listed in Table 1 below in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling. Table 1 Drug	FFPET	PlasmaTARCEVA (erlotinib)	Exon 19 deletions and L858R	Exon 19 deletions and L858RTAGRISSO (osimertinib)	T790M		Patients with positive cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 test results using plasma specimens for the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations are eligible for treatment with TARCEVA (erlotinib). Patients who are negative for these mutations by this test should be reflexed to routine biopsy and testing for EGFR mutations with the FFPET sample type. Drug safety and efficacy have not been established for the EGFR mutations listed in Table 2 below that are also detected by the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2.

The cobas z 480 analyzer is used for automated amplification and detection.
