Approval  for the nidek ec-5000 excimer laser system. this device is indicated for topography-assisted laser- assisted in-situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatment using the final fit custom ablation treatment planning software for the reduction or elimination of myopic refractive errors from -1.0 to -4.0 d of sphere with astigmatic refractive errors from >-0.5 to -2.0 d at the spectacle plane; in patients 21 years of age or older; and, in patients with documented stability of manifest refraction over the prior year, demonstrated by a change in mrse not greater than 0.5 d.
