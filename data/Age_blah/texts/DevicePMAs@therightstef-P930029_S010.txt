Approval to implement design changes in the RF Performr catheter that will result in the ability of the catheter to deflect in two directions rather than one and the inclusion of a self reference electrode on some models.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name the RF Conductr MC Self-Reference Catheters and is indicated for the interruption of accessory atrioventricular (AV) conduction pathways associated with tachycardia, for the treatment of AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, and for creation of complete AV block in patients with a difficult to control ventricular response to an atrial arrhythmia.
