Approval for the migration of claims from the fda approved elecsys anti-hbc immunoassay and elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc on the modular analytics e170 to the cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzer. the device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name elecsys anti-hbc immunoassay and elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc and is indicated for: elecsys anti-hbc immunoassay the elecsys anti-hbc immunoassay is for the in vitro qualitative determination of total antibodies to hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc) in human serum and plasma (lithiumheparin, sodium citrate, kredta) in adult patients with the symptoms of hepatitis or who may be at risk for hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. the detection of total anti-hbc is indicative of a laboratory diagnosis for hbv infection. further hbv serological marker testing is required to define the specific disease state. the elecsys anti-hbc immunoassay's performance has not been established for the monitoring of hbv disease or therapy. the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "eclia" is intended for use on the modular analytics e 170, cobas e 60 i and co bas e 602 immunoassay analyzers. elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc is used for quality control of the elecsys anti-hbc immunoassay on the modular analytics e 170, cobas e 60 i and cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.
