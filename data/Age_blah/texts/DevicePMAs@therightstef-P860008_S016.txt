The device is indicated for 1) the termination of supraventricular tachycardia (atrial flutter and re-entrant atrial or atrio-ventricular paroxysmal tachycardias) in children via an esophageal catheter electrode; 2) the acceleration of heart rate in adults via a Pill-Electrode as an alternative to exercise during diagnostic studies such as echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography; and 3) use in patients who develop bradycardia during general anesthesia and require acceleration of heart rate.
