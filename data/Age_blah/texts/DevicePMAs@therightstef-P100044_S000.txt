Approval for the propel sinus implant.  This device is indicated for use in patients >= 18 years of age following ethmoid sinus surgery to maintain patency, thereby reducing the need for post-operative intervention such as surgical adhesion lysis and/or use of oral steroids.  The propel sinus implant separates mucosal tissues, provides stabilization of the middle turbinate, prevents obstruction by adhesions, and reduces edema.
