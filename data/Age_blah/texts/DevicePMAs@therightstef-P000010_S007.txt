Approval for the extension of the shelf life to 24 months of the hcv master mix, version 2,.0, a component of the amplicor hcv test, v2.0.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name amplicor hcv test, v2.0 and is indicated for the qualitative detection of hcv rna inhuman serum or plasma from blood collected in edta (edta plasma).  The test detects by reverse transcribing target hcv rna in complimentary dna (cdna), amplifying cdna by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), hybridizing amplified cdna with an oligonucleotide probe that binds enzyme, and catalyzing conversion of substrate to a colored product that is recognized by a microwell plate reader.  The amplicor hcv test, v2.0 is indicated for patients who have evidence of liver disease and antibody evidence of hcv infection, and who are suspected to be actively infected with hcv.  Detection of hcv rna indicates that the virus is replicating and therefore is evidence of active hcv infection.
