Approval for a change from the qualitative detection of total anti-hbs in human serum to a quantitative detection of total anti-hbs in human serum.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbs quantitative reagent pack and vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbs calibrators.  The vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbs quantitative reagent pack is indicated for:  "the quantitative in vitro determination of total antibody to hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) in human serum using the vitros eci/eciq immunodiagnostic system.  Assay results may be used as an aid in the determination of susceptibility to hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection for individuals prior to or following hbv vaccination, or where vaccination status is unknown.  Assay results may be used with other hbv serological markers for the laboratory diagnosis of hbv disease associated with hbv infection.  A reactive assay result will allow a differential diagnosis in individuals displaying signs and symptoms of hepatitis, in whom etiology is unknown."  the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbs calibrators is indicated for: "for use in the calibration of the vitros ici/eciq immunodiagnostic system for the quantitative in vitro determination of total antibody to hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) in human serum using the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbs quantitative reagent pack."
