Approval for device design modifications to reduce the sample input volume, improve genotype inclusivity, and improve assay sensitivity to 15 iu/ml. the device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name cobas ampliprep/cobas taqman hcv test, v2.0 and is indicated for:  the cobas ampliprep/cobas taqman hcv test, v2.0 is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the quantitation of hepatitis c viral (hcv) rna genotypes 1 to 6 in human edta plasma or serum of hcv-infected individuals using the cobas ampliprep instrument for automated specimen processing and the cobas taqman analyzer or the cobas taqman 48 analyzer for automated amplification and detection. the test is intended for use inthe management of patients with chronic hcv in conjunction with clinical and laboratory markers of infection. the test can be used to predict the probability of sustained virologic response (svr) early during a course of antiviral therapy, and to assess viral response to antiviral treatment (response guided therapy) as measured by changes of hcv rna levels in serum or edta plasma.  Assay performance characteristics have been established for individuals treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. no information is available on the assay's predictive value when other therapies are used. assay performance for determining the state of hcv infection has not been established.  The cobas ampliprep/ cobas taqman hcv test is not intended for use as a screening test for the presence of hcv in blood or blood products or as a diagnostic test to confirm the presence of hcv infection.
