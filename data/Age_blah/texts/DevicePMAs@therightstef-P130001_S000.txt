The Epi proColon test is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of methylated Septin 9 DNA in EDTA plasma derived from patient whole blood specimens. Methylation of the target DNA sequence in the promoter region of the SEPT9_v2 transcript has been associated with the occurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC). The test uses a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a fluorescent hydrolysis probe for the methylation specific detection of the Septin 9 DNA target.  The Epi proColon test is indicated to screen adults of either sex, 50 years or older, defined as average risk for CRC, who have been offered and have a history of not completing CRC screening. Tests that are available and recommended in the USPSTF 2008 CRC screening guidelines should be offered and declined prior to offering the Epi proColon test. Patients with a positive Epi proColon test result should be referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. The Epi proColon test results should be used in combination with physician's assessment and individual risk factors in guiding patient management.
