Approval for the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx for expanding the indications to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and urothelial cancer patients. This device is indicated for the following: For in vitro diagnostic use. PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-PD-L1, Clone 28-8 intended for use in the detection of PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma (UC), and melanoma tissues using EnVision FLEX visualization system on Autostainer Link 48. PD-L1 protein expression is defined as the percentage of evaluable tumor cells exhibiting partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. Tumor PD-L1 status is defined by indication specific staining interpretation. 	Tumor Indication*	Intended Use	PD-L1 Expression Clinical Cut off	nsNSCLC	PD-L1 expression as detected by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in non-squamous NSCLC and SCCHN may be associated with enhanced survival from OPDIVO (nivolumab).	>=1%, >=5%, >=10%	SCCHN		>=1%	UC	PD-L1 expression as detected by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in UC may be associated with enhanced response rate from OPDIVO.	>=1%	Melanoma	Positive PD-L1 status as determined by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in melanoma is correlated with the magnitude of the treatment effect on progression-free survival from OPDIVO.	>=1%	*For details on staining interpretation, refer to section 13 of the product insert and indication specific PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx Interpretation Manuals.
