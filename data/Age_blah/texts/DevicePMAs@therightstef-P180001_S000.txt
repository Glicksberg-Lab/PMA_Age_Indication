Approval for the endovascular treatment of patients with Type B aortic dissection. The Zenith TX2 Dissection Endovascular Graft with Pro-Form is intended to seal the entry tear(s) and to exclude aneurysms associated with chronic dissections. The Zenith Dissection Endovascular Stent is intended to be used as a distal component to provide support to delaminated segments of non-aneurysmal aorta with dissection distal to a Zenith TX2 Dissection Endovascular Graft with Pro-Form.  The system is indicated for use in patients having suitable vascular anatomy for endovascular repair, including: adequate iliac/femoral access compatible with the required introduction systems; for the Zenith TX2 Dissection Endovascular Graft with Pro-Form: non-dissected/aneurysmal aortic segments (fixation sites) distal to the left common carotid artery and proximal to the entry tear with a length of at least 20 mm for the graft, and non-dissected/aneurysmal aortic segments (fixation sites) distal to the left common carotid artery and proximal to the entry tear with a diameter (measured outer-wall to outer-wall) of no greater than 38 mm and no less than 20 mm for the graft; for the Zenith Dissection Endovascular Stent: diameter at non-aneurysmal intended implant site for the stent (measured outer-wall to outer- wall) of no greater than 38 mm (true lumen) and no less than 20 mm (total aortic diameter).
