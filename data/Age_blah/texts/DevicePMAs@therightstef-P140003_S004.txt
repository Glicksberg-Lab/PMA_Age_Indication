Approval for the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, and Impella LD catheters, in conjunction with the Automated Impella Controller, are temporary ventricular support devices intended for short term use (<= 4 days for the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP, and <=6 days for the Impella 5.0 and Impella LD) and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately (<48 hours) following acute myocardial infarction or open heart surgery as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures.* The intent of the Impella System therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function.*Optimal medical management and conventional measures include volume loading, use of pressors and inotropes support with or without IABP.
