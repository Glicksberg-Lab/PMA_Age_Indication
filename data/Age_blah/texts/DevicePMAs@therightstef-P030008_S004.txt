Approval for the wavelight allegretto wave excimer laser system.  The device used optical zones of 6.0-7.0 mm with an ablation/treatment zone up to 9.0 mm, and is indicated for laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik) for: 1) the reduction or elimination of naturally occurring mixed astigmatism of up to 6.00 diopters (d) at the spectacle plane; 2) patients who are 21 years of age or older; and 3) patients with documentation of a stable manifest refraction defined as <= 0.50 d preoperative spherical equivalent shift over one year prior to surgery.
