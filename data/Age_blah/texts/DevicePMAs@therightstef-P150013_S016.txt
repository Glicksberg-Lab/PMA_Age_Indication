Approval for the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx.  PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using monoclonal mouse anti-PD-L1, Clone 22C3 intended for use in the detection of PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), cervical cancer, urothelial carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues using EnVision FLEX visualization system on Autostainer Link 48. PD-L1 protein expression in NSCLC is determined by using Tumor Proportion Score (TPS), which is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. PD-L1 protein expression in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, ESCC, cervical cancer, urothelial carcinoma and HNSCC is determined by using Combined Positive Score (CPS), which is the number of PD-L1 staining cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100.Companion Diagnostic IndicationsTumor Indication	PD-L1 Expression Level	Intended UseNSCLC	TPS  greater than or equal to 1%	PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying NSCLC patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). **Gastric or GEJ Adenocarcinoma	CPS greater than or equal to  1	PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab).ESCC	 CPS greater than or equal to   10	PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying esophageal squamous cell cancer patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab).
