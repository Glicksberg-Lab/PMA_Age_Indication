Approval for the affinity cage system.  This device is indicated for anterior cervical interbody fusion procedures in skeletally mature patients with cervical disc disease at one level from the c2-c3 disc to the c7-t1 disc.  Cervical disc disease is defined as intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with herniated disc and/or osteophyte formation on posterior vertebral endplates producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord compression confirmed by radiographic studies.  Affinity implants are to be used with autogenous bone graft and implanted via an open, anterior approach.
