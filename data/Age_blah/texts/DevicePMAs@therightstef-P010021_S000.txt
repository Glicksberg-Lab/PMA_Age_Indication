Approval for the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hcv reagent pack and vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hcv calibrator.  These devices are indicated for: the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hcv reagent pack is indicated for the in vitro qualitative detection of immunoglobulin g antibody to hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv) in human serum and plasma (heparin, edta and sodium citrate) using the vitros eci immunodiagnostic system.  Three recombinant hepatitis c virus encoded antigens are used.  Assay results, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to provide presumptive evidence of infection with hepatitis c virus (state or associated disease not determined) in persons with signs or symptoms of hepatitis and in persons at risk for hepatitis c infection. the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hcv calibrator is indicated for use in the calibration of the vitros eci immunodiagnostic system for the in vitro qualitative detection of immunoglobulin g antibody to hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv) in human serum and plasma (heparin, edta and sodium citrate) using vitros anti-hcv reagent packs.  The vitros anti-hcv calibrator has been validated for use only on the vitros eci immunodiagnostic system with the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hcv reagent pack.
