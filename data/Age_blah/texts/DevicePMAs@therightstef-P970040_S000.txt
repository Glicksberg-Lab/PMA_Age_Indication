The device is indicated as follows:  The Achilles+ultrasonometer measures ultrasound variables of the os calcis to provide a clinical measure called Stiffness Index.  The Stiffnes Index indicateds risk of osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women comparable to bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by X-ray absorptiometry at teh spine or hip.  Stiffness Index results expressed as T-scores are used to assist the physicians in the diagnosis of osteoporosis in the same way as are T-scores or obtained by X-ray absorpiometry.  either the Stiffness Index T-score or X-ray absorptiometry T-score can be utilized by a physician, in conjunction with other clinical risk factors, to provide a comprehensive skeletal assessment.  The Stiffness Index has a precision error in older women comparable to that of x-ray absorptiometry, which makes it suitable for moniotirng bone changes.
