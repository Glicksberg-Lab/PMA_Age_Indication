Approval for the STAR S4 IR Excimer Laser System and iDesign Advanced WaveScan Studio System.  The STAR S4 IR Excimer Laser System and iDesign Advanced WaveScan Studio System is indicated for Wavefront-guided laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in patients: 1)	with hyperopia with and without astigmatism as measured by iDesign Advanced        WaveScan Studio System up to +4.00 D spherical equivalent, with up to 2.00 D cylinder; 2)	with agreement between manifest refraction (adjusted for optical infinity) and        iDesign Advanced WaveScan Studio System refraction as follows:            - Spherical Equivalent: Magnitude of the difference is less than 0.625 D.           - Cylinder: Magnitude of the difference is less than or equal to 0.5 D; 3)	18 years of age or older; and4)	with refractive stability (a change of less than or equal to 1.0 D in sphere or cylinder for a minimum of 12 months prior to surgery).
