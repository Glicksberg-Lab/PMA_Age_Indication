Approval for the vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbc reagent pack and vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbc calibrator.  These devices are indicated for:  1) vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbc reagent pack is indicated for the in vitro  qualitative detection of total antibody (igg and igm) to hepatitis b core antigen (total anti-hbc) in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma (edta and citrate) and neonate serum using the vitros eci immunodiagnostic system.  Assay results, in conjunction with other serological and clinical information, may be used for the laboratory diagnosis of individuals with acute or chronic hepatitis b, or recovery from hepatitis b infection.  The presence of anti-hbc may be used as an aid in the determination of exposure to hbv infection for individuals prior to hbv vaccination.  2) vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hbc calibrator is indicated for use in the calibration of the vitros eci immunodiagnostic system when used for the in vitro qualitative detection of total antibody (igg and igm) to hepatitis b core antigen (total anti-hbc) in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma (edta and citrate) and neonate serum using vitros anti-hbc reagent packs.
