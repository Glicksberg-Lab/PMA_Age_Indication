Approval for the immulite / immulite 1000 and immulite 2000 free psa assay.  These devices are indicated for:  the immulite / immulite 1000 free psa assay is indicated for in vitro diagnostic use with the immulite / immulite 1000 analyzer for the quantitative measurement of free prostate-specific antigen (psa) not bound to alpha 1-antichymotrypsin or other binding proteins (uncomplexed) in human serum (including serum collected in serum glass, serum plastic an serum gel separator tubes).  Measurement of free psa is used in conjunction with immulite / immulite 1000 total psa to determine a ratio of free psa to total psa (percent free psa).  The percent free psa is used as an aid in discriminating prostate cancer from benign disease in men 50 years or older with immulite / immulite 1000 total psa values between 4 and 10 ng/ml and digital rectal exam (dre) findings not suspicious of cancer.  Prostate biopsy is required for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
