Approval for the medtronic kinetra model 7428 implantable neurostimulation system which includes the model 7428 kinetra neurostimulator, model 7436 access therapy controller, model 8840 n'vision programmer, model 8870 software application card, model 7459 memorymod software cartridge, and model 3550-09 accessory kit.  These are revisions to the existing medtronic activa parkinson's control therapy also known as the activa system.  The medtronic kinetra model 7428 implantable neurostimulation system is only indicated for bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (gpi) or the subthalamic nucleus (stn) as an adjunctive therapy in reducing some of the symptoms of advanced, levodopa-responsive parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.  Additionally, this supplement also incorporates the latest magnetic resonance imaging (mri) labeling information with respect to the above systems.
