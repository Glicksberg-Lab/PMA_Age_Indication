Approval for the The Oncomine Dx Target Test is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test that uses targeted high throughput, parallel-sequencing technology to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and deletions in 23 genes from DNA and fusions in ROS1 from RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using the Ion PGM Dx System. The test is indicated to aid in selecting NSCLC patients for treatment with the targeted therapies listed in Table 1 in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling. Table 1.  List of variants for therapeutic useGene	Variant	Targeted therapyBRAF	BRAF V600E	TAFINLAR (dabrafenib) in combination with MEKINIST (trametinib) ROS1	ROS1 fusions	XALKORI (crizotinib) EGFR	L858R, Exon 19 deletions	IRESSA (gefitinib) Safe and effective use has not been established for selecting therapies using this device for the variants in Table 1 in tissue types other than NSCLC. Results other than those listed in Table 1 are indicated for use only in patients who have already been considered for all appropriate therapies (including those listed in Table 1). Analytical performance using NSCLC specimens has been established for the variants listed in Table 2.Table 2.
