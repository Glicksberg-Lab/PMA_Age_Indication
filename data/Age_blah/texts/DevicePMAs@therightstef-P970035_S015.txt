The device is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo lesions (length <30 mm) in native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters ranging from 3.0 and 4.0 mm.  Long term outcome (beyond 14 days) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.  The rapid exchange delivery system will allow for perfusion at an average rate of 2 cc/min at nominal pressue during the 15-30 second stent deployment procedure only.  The rapid exchange stent delivery system is not intended for use as a stand alone PTCA perfusion catheter.
