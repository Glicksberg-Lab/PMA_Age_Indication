Approval for the ventana  medical systems' pathway anti-c-kit (9.7) primary antibody.  The device is indicated as follows: ventana medical systems' pathway anti-c-kit (9.7) primary antibody is intended for laboratory use, via light microscopy, for the qualitative detection of kit protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) using either an automated immunohistochem-istry staining system or a manual assay.  It is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of gist within the context of the patient's clinical history, tumor morphology, and other diagnostic tests evaluated by a qualified pathologist.  It may be used after the diagnosis of gist as an aid in the selection of gist patients who may qualify for imatinib mesylate (gleevec ) therapy.  Pathway anti-c-kit (9.7) primary antibody is optimized for use on ventana automated slide stainer and for manual application in combination with ventana medical systems' iview dab detection kit and accessories.  The clinical interpretation of any staining, or the absence of staining, must be complemented by morphological studies and evaluation of proper controls.  Evaluation must be made by a qualified pathologist within the context of the patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests.
