Approval for the elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay and elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc igm for use on the modular anal ytics e170 immunoassay analyzer. this device is indicated for: the elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay is intended for the in vitro qualitative determination of igm antibodies to hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc igm) in humanserum or plasma (potassium edta, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, sodium citrate) in adult patients with symptoms of hepatitis or who may be at risk for hepatitis b (hbv) infection. the presence of anti-hbc igm, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, is indicative of acute or recent hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. the elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay's performance has not been established for the monitoring of hbv disease or therapy.  The ectrochemiluminescence immunoassay "eclia" is intended for use on the modular anal ytics e170 immunoassay analyzer.  Elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc igm is used for quality control of the elecsys anti-hbcigm immunoassay on the modular anal ytics e170 immunoassay analyzer.
