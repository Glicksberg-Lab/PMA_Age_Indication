Approval for the dakocytomation   c-kit pharmdx.  Dakocytomation c-kit pharmdx on the dako autostainer: the c-kit pharmdx assay is a qualitative immunohistochemical (ihc) kit system used on the dako autostainer, for the identification of c-kit protein/cd117 antigen (c-kit protein) expression in normal and neoplastic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues for histological evaluation.  The c-kit pharmdx rabbit polyclonal antibodies specifically detect the c-kit protein in cd117 antigen-expressing cells.  The c-kit pharmdx is indicated as an aid in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist).  After diagnosis of gist, results from c-kit pharmdx may be used as an aid in identifying those patients eligible for treatment with gleevec/glivec (imatinib mesylate).  Results from hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) stains and a panel of antibodies can aid in the differential diagnosis of gist.  Interpretation must be made by a qualified pathologist, within the context of a patient's clinical history, proper controls, and other diagnostic test.
