Approval for the mel 80 excimer laser system.  The device uses an optical zone of 6.0 to 7.0 mm in diameter and a transition zone of 1.7 to 1.9 mm for total ablation diameter of 7.7 to 8.9 mm, and is indicated for primary laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatments for: 1) the reduction or elimination of myopia of less than or equal to -7.0 d, with or without refractive astigmatism of less than or equal to -3.0 d, with a maximum mrse of -7.00 d; 2) in patients who are 21 years of age or older; 3) with documentation of stable manifest refraction over the past year as demonstrated by change in sphere and cylinder of <=0.5d.
