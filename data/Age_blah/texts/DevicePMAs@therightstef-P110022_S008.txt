Approval for the migration of claims from the fda approved elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay and elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc igm on the cobas e 601 to the cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzer. the device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay and elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc igm and is indicated for: elecsys anti-hbc lgm immunoassaythe elecsys anti-hbc lgm immunoassay is intended for the in vitro qualitativedetermination ofigm antibodies to hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc igm) in human serum or plasma (potassium edta, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, sodium citrate) in adult patients with symptoms of hepatitis or who may be at risk for hepatitis b (hbv) infection.  The presence of anti-hbc igm, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinicalinformation, is indicative of acute or recent hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. the elecsys anti-hbc lgm immunoassay's performance has not been established for the monitoring of hbv disease or therapy. the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "eclia" is intended for use on the cobas e 601 and cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.  Elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc igm is used for quality control of the elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay on the cobas e 601  andcobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.
