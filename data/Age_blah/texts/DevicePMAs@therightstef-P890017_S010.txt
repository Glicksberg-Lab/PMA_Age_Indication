Approval for the cordis palmaz balloon expandable stent (models p104r, p154r, p204r).  The device is indicated for use in patients with atherosclerotic disease of the renal arteries following suboptimal percutaneous renal angioplasty (ptra) of a de novo or restenotic lesion (<=22 mm in length) located within 10 mm of the aortorenal artery border and with a reference vessel diameter of >= 4 mm and <= 8 mm.  Suboptimal ptra results are defined by one or more of the following unfavorable results: >= 50% residual stenosis by visual estimate, >= 20 mm hg peak translesional pressure gradient, >= 10 mm hg mean translesional pressure gradient, and/or grade d dissection (a spiral shaped filling defect within the lumen of the vessel) or any dissection with significant compromise in lumen flow.
