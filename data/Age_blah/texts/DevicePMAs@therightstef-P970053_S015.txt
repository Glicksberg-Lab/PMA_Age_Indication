Approval for the a new 1 khz eyetracker, which replaces the original 200 hz eyetracker used with the ec-5000 excimer laser. this change also includes modification to the associated camera and software as well as the infrared red (ir) illumination. this device is indicated for topography-assisted laser- assisted in-situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatment using the final fit custom ablation treatment planning software for the reduction or elimination of myopic refractive errors from -1.0 to - 4.0 d of sphere with astigmatic refractive errors from >-0.5 to -2.0 d at the spectacle plane; in patients 21 years of age or older; and, in patients with documented stability of manifest refraction over the prior year, demonstrated by a change in mrse not greater than +=0.5 d.
