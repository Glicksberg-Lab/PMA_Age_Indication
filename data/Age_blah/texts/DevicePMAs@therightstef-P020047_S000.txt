Approval for the multi-link rx and otw vision coronary stent systems (css).  These devices are indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in the following: 1) patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete de novo or restenotic native coronary artery lesions (length <25 mm) with reference vessel diameters ranging from 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm.  2)  patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to lesions in saphenous vein bypass grafts (length <25 mm) with reference vessel diameters ranging from 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm  3) restoring coronary flow in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction, as confirmed by st segment elevation or angiographic findings, who present within 12 hours of symptom onset with native coronary artery lesions of length <25 mm with a reference vessel diameter of 3.0 mm to 4.0 mm.  Outcome (beyond 9 months) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.
