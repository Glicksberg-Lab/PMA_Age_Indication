Approval for the wavelight allegretto wave excimer laser system.  The devices uses optical zones of 6.0 and 6.5 mm with an ablation/treatment zone up to 9.0 mm, and is indicated for laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik):  1) for the reduction or elimination of hyperopic refractive errors up to +6.0 diopters (d) of sphere with and without astigmatic refractive errors up to 5.0 d at the spectacle plane, with a maximum manifest refraction spherical equivalent (mrse) of +6.0 d;  2) in patients who are 18 years of age or older; and  3) in patients with documentation of a stable manifest refraction defined as <=0.50 d of preoperative spherical equivalent shift over one year prior to surgery, exclusive of changes due to unmasking latent hyperopia.
