Approval for the star s4 excimer laser system with variable spot scanning (vss) and wavescan wavefront system.  The device uses a 6.00 mm optical zone, a 9.00 mm treatment zone, and is indicated for wavefront-guided laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik): 1) for the reduction or elimination of hyperopia an d hyperopic astigmatism up to 3.00 d mrse, with cylinder between 0.00 and 2.00 d; 2) in patients 21 years of age or older; and 3) in patients with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of no more than 1.0 d (in both cylinder and sphere components) for at least one year prior to the date of pre-operative examination.
