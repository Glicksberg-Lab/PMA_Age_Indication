Approval for for the navistar/celsius thermocool deflectable diagnostic/ablation catheters, which include these models: navistar thermocool (models ns75t-bct-252-hs, ns75t-cct-252-hs, ns75t-dct-252-hs, ns75t-fct-252-hs, ns75tc-bct-252-hs, ns75tc-cct-252-hs, ns75tc-dct-252-hs, and ns75tc-fct-252-hs); and celsius thermocool (models d7it-bl-252-rt, d7it-dl-252-rt, d7it-fl-252-rt, d7itc-bl-252-rt, d7itc-dl-252-rt, and d7itc-fl-252-rt).  The biosense webster navistar/celsius thermocool diagnostic/ablation deflectable tip catheters and related accessory devices are indicated for catheter-based cardiac electrophysiological mapping (stimulating and recording), and when used with the stockert 70 generator, for the treatment of type i atrial flutter in patients age 18 or older.  The navistar thermocool catheter provides location information when used with the carto ep/xp navigation system.
