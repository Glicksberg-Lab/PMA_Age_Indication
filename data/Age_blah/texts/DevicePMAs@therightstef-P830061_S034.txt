Approval for pacing leads that incorporate a new surface coating, a new electrode geometry, a new combination of previously used steroids, and a new tapered stylet.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade names capsure sense lead models 4074/4574/4073 and the vitatron crystalline lead models icm09b, icm09jb, and icm09.  These devices are indicated for pacing or sensing in the atrium or ventricle.  The leads have application where implantable atrial or ventricular single-chamber or dual-chamber pacing systems are indicated.
