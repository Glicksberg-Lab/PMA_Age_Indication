Approval for VENTANA PD L1 (SP142) Assay is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD L1 clone SP142.  The device is intended for use in the assessment of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues indicated below stained with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit and OptiView Amplification Kit on a VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument. Determination of PD-L1 status is indication-specific, and evaluation is based on either the proportion of tumor area occupied by PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity or the percentage of PD-L1 expressing tumor cells (% TC) of any intensity. VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay is indicated as an aid for identifying patients for treatment with the therapies for the respective cutoffs listed in Table 1 in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling.             Table 1.
