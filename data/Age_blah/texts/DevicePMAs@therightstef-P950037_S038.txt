Approval for the addition of a drug collar to the pacing lead.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name selox st/jt and is indicated as follows:  selox st and selox jt steroid eluting leads are designed for use with implantable pulse generators that require pacing leads with a bipolar 3.2 mm is-1 connector configuration; they may be used with single or dual chamber pacing systems.  The leads are designed for use in patients for whom single or dual chamber pulse generator therapy is medically indicated.  This indication follows that recommended in the class i definition of the acc/aha/naspe task force report, entitled "acc/aha/naspe 2002 guideline update for implantation of cardiac pacemakers and antiarrhythmia devices: a report of the american college of cardiology/american heart association task force on practice guidelines (acc/aha/naspe committee on pacemaker implantation)" (gregoratos et al. 2002).
