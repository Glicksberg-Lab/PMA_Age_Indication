Approval for the ladarvision(r) excimer laser system.  The device is indicated for laser in-situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatments: 1) for the reduction or eliminatino of refractive error of less than or equal to +6.00d of sphere and -6.00d of cylinder at the spectacle plane (hyperopia with or without astigmatism and mixed astigmatism); 1) in subjects with documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 months, as demonstrated by a change of less than or equal to 0.50d for corrections up to +6.00d se; and, 3) in subjects who are 21 years of age or older.
