The device as modified, will be marketed under the trade name vitros immunodiagnostic products anti-hcv reagent pack and calibrator with the addition of model designations (eciq/eci), and is indicated as follows: for the in vitro qualitative detection of immunoglobulin g antibody to hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv) in human serum and plasma (heparin, edta and sodium citrate) using the vitros eci/eciq immunodiagnostic system.  Three recombinant hepatitis c virus encoded antigens are used.  Assay results, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to provide presumptive evidence of infection with hepatitis c virus, (state or associated disease not determined), in persons with signs or symptoms of hepatitis and in persons at risk for hepatitis c infection.
