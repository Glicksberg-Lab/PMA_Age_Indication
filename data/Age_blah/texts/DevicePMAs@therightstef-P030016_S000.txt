The device is indicated for adults 21-45 years of age: 1) to correct myopia ranging from -3.0 diopters to <=-15.0 diopters with less than or equal to 2.5 diopters of astigmatism at the spectacle plane; 2) to reduce myopia ranging from greater than -15.0 diopters to -20.0 diopters with less than or equal to 2.5 diopters of astigmatism at the spectacle plane; and 3) with an anterior chamber depth (acd) 3.00 mm or greater, and a stable refractive history within 0.5 diopter for 1 year prior to implantation.
