Approval for a disposable dual-barrel piston-driven syringe dispensing system as an alternate to the current dual-barrel reusable ratcheting piston-driven cartridge system.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name bg3500 and is indicated for use as an adjunct to standard methods of achieving hemostasis (such as sutures and staples) in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels (such as aorta, femoral, and carotid arteries).
