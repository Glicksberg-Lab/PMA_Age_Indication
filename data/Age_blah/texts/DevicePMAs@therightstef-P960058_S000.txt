Approval for the clarion multi-strategy cochlear implant.  The device is intended to restore a level of auditory sensation to children with profound sensorineural deafness via electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.  Clarion is indicated for the following: 1)children, 2 through 17 years of age.  If x-rays demonstrate evidence of ossification, children as young as 18 months may be implanted; 2)profound, bilateral sensorineural deafness; 3)undergone or be willing to undergo a hearing aid trail with appropriately fitted hearing aids; 4)lack of benefit from appropriately fitting hearing aids.  In younger children, lack of benefit with hearing aids is defined as failure to attain basic auditory milestones such as a child's inconsistent response to his/her name in quiet or to environmental sounds (meaningful auditory integration scale).  In older children, lack of aided benefit is defined as scoring 0% on open-set word recognition (phonetically balanced kindergarten test - word list) administered with monitored live-voice (70 db spl).  Both younger and older children should demonstrate only minimal ability on age appropriate open-set sentence measures and a plateau in auditory development.
