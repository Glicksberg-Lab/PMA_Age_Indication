Approval for the medtronic at500 dddrp pacing system (model at501) and model 9968 software.  The medtronic at500 dddrp pacing system is indicated for the following:  1) rate adaptive pacing in patients who may benefit from increased pacing rates concurrent with increases in activity.  2) accepted patient conditions warranting chronic cardiac pacing which include: a) symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent second or third-degree av block.  B) symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block.  C)  symptomatic paroxysmal or transient sinus node dysfunctions with or without associated av conduction disorders.  D) bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome to prevent symptomatic bradycardia or some forms of symptomatic tachyarrhythmias. the medtronic at500 system is also indicated for dual chamber and atrial tracking modes in patients who may benefit from maintenance of av synchrony.  Dual chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of conduction disorders that require restoration of both rate and av synchrony, which include:  1) various degrees of av block to maintain the atrial contribution to cardiac output.  2) vvi intolerance (e. g., pacemaker syndrome) in the presence of persistent sinus rhythm.  Antitachycardia pacing (atp) is indicated for termination of atrial tachyarrhythmias in bradycardia patients with one or more of the above pacing indications.  Atrial rhythm management features such as atrial rate stabilization (ars) atrial preference pacing (app), and post mode switch overdrive pacing (pmop) are indicated for the suppression of atrial tachyarrhythmias in bradycardia patients with atrial septal lead placement and one or more of the above pacing indications.
