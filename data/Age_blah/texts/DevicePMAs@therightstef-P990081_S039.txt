Approval for the Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.'s (Ventana) PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody (PATHWAY HER2 (4B5)) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody intended for laboratory use for the semi-quantitative detection of HER2 antigen in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue following staining on a BenchMark XT or BenchMark ULTRA instrument. It is indicated as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom Herceptin (trastuzumab) or KADCYLA (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) treatment is being considered. Note: All of the patients in the Herceptin clinical trials were selected using a clinical trial assay. None of the patients in those trials were selected using PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5). PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) was compared to PATHWAY HER-2 (clone CB11) Primary Antibody on an independent sample set and found to provide acceptably concordant results. The actual correlation of PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) to clinical outcome has not been established. This product should be interpreted by a qualified pathologist in conjunction with histological examination, relevant clinical information, and proper controls. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use.
