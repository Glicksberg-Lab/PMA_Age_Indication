Approval for a shortened version of the drug-eluting sinus stent.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name propel mini sinus implant and is indicated for use in patients >= 18 years of age following ethmoid sinus surgery to maintain patency, thereby reducing the need for post-operative intervention such as surgical adhesion lysis and/or use of oral steroids. the propel mini sinus implant separates mucosal tissues, provides stabilization of the middle turbinate, prevents obstruction by adhesions, and reduces edema.
