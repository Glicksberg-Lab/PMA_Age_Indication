Approval for the express and express2 monorail and over-the-wire coronary stent systems.  These devices are indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in the following:  1) patients with symptomatic ischemic disease associated with stenotic lesions in native coronary arteries (length < 18 mm) with a reference vessel diameter of 3.0 to 5.0 mm.  2) treatment of abrupt or threatened abrupt closure (ac/tac) in patients with failed interventional therapy in lesions in native coronary arteries of 2.25 to 5.0 mm (inclusive) in diameter and < 30 mm long.  Long-term outcome (beyond 6 months) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.
