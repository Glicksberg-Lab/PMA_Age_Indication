This device is indicated for the dilatation of stenoses in coronary arteries for the purpose of improving myocardial perfusion in those circumstances where a high pressure balloon resistant lesion is encountered.  In addition, the target lesion should possess the fillowing characteristics: discrete (<=15 mm in length) or tubular (10 to 20 mm in length) with a reference vessel diameter ranging from 2.0 mm to 4.0 mm; readily accessible to the device; light to moderate tortuosity of proximal vessel segment, non-angulated lesion segment (<45 degrees), smooth angiographic contour; and absence of angiographically-visible thrombus and/or calcification.
