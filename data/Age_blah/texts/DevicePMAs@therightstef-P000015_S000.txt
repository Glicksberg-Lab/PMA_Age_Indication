Approval for the nucleus 24 auditory brainstem implant (abi) system, which is intended to restore useful hearing via electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus.  The device is indicated for individuals 12 years of age or older, who have been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 2 (nf2).  Implantation may occur during first or second-side tumor removal, or in patients with previously removed acoustic tumors bilaterally.  Because the surgical procedure for tumor excision and electrode placement eliminates residual hearing, preoperative audiological criteria are not relevant.  Prospective implant recipients and their families should have appropriate expectations, regarding the potential benefits of an auditory brainstem implant and should be highly motivated to participate in the postopearative rehabilitation process.
