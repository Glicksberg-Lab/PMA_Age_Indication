Approval for a modification of the intended use statement as follows:  "the device is further indicated for use in conjunction with other clinical info as an aid in assessing the risk of preterm delivery in < 34 weeks, 6 days when a cervicovaginal sample is obtained during a routine prenatal visit between 22 weeks, 0 days and 30 weeks, 6 days of gestation in women with a singleton gestation. the positive predictive value ranges from 13.3% to 31.7% for delivery in < 34 weeks, 6 days and represents an approximate 4- to 7-fold increase in risk over the reliability of predicting delivery given no test info.  The negative predictive value ranges from 96.4% to 97.9% making it highly likely that delivery will not occur in these time frames."
