Approval for the visx star s2 and s3 excimer laser systems.  The devices are indicated for laser in-situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatments:  1) in patients with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of no more than 0.5 d (in both cylinder and sphere components) for at least one year prior to the date of pre-operative examination; and  2) in patients 21 years of age of older in treatments for the reduction or elimination of naturally occurring mixed astigmatism where the magnitude of cylinder (<=6.0 d at the spectacle plane) is greater than the magnitude of sphere and the cylinder and sphere have opposite signs.
