Approval for clarifications to the indications for use statements related to the optivol feature and other modifications to the device labeling. the devices are indicated as follows:  dual chamber icdsthe <device name> dr system is indicated to provide ventricular antitachycardia pacing and ventricular defibrillation for automated treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.  In addition, the device is indicated for use in the above patients with atrialtachyarrhythmias, or those patients who are at significant risk of developing atrial tachyarrhythmias.  Notes: 1) the use of the device has not been demonstrated to decrease the morbidity related to atrial tachyarrhythmias. 2) the effectiveness of high-frequency burst pacing (atrial 50 hz burst therapy) in terminating device classified atrial tachycardia (at) was found to be 17%, and in terminating device classified atrial fibrillation (af) was found to be 16.8%, in the vt/at patient population studied.  3) the effectiveness of high-frequency burst pacing (atrial 50 hz burst therapy) in terminating device classified atrial tachycardia (at) was found to be 11.7%, and in terminating device classified atrial fibrillation (af) was found to 18.2% in the af-only patient population studied. single chamber icds:  the <device name> vr system is indicated to provide ventricular antitachycardia pacing and ventricular defibrillation for automated treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
