Cologuard is for use with the Cologuard collection kit and the following instruments: BioTek Epoch 2 Absorbance Microplate Reader; Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR; Hamilton Microlab STARlet; and the Exact Sciences System Software with Cologuard Test Definition. This assay is to be performed at Exact Sciences Laboratory, located at 145 E. Badger Rd, Suite 100, Madison, Wisconsin. Cologuard is intended for the qualitative detection of colorectal neoplasia associated DNA markers and for the presence of occult hemoglobin in human stool. A positive result may indicate the presence of colorectal cancer (CRC) or advanced adenoma (AA) and should be followed by diagnostic colonoscopy. Cologuard is indicated to screen adults of either sex, 50 years or older, who are at typical average-risk for CRC. Cologuard is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high risk individuals.
