Approval for the lasersight laserscan lsx excimer laser system for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik).  The device is indicated for lasik:  1) for the reduction or elimination of myopia ranging from -0.5 to less than -6.0 diopters (d) spherical equivalent, with astigmatism less than or equal to 4.5 d, as measured at the spectacle plane;  2) in patients with documentation of a stable manifest refraction defined as <= 0.50 d, or <= 10% of preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (ser) shift over one year prior to surgery; and,  3) in patients who are 18 years of age or older.
