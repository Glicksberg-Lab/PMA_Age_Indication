Approval for the transition of the advia centaur hbc igm assay to a new platform in the centaur family of instruments, the centaur cp. the device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name advia centaur hbc igm assay and is indicated for: advia centaur hbc igm readypack reagents on the centaur cp analyzer: the advia centaur hbc igm assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitativedetermination of igm response to hepatitis b virus core antigen in human serum andplasma (edta or lithium or sodium heparinized) using the advia centaur cp system. the assay uses recombinant hbc antigen. this assay may be used in combination withother hepatitis b virus (hbv) marker assays to define the clinical status of known hbvinfected patients or can be combined with other hbv, hav (hepatitis a virus), and hcv(hepatitis c virus) assays for the diagnosis of patients presenting symptoms of acute viral hepatitis.  Assay performance characteristics have not been established for immunocompro-mised orimmunosuppressed patients, cord blood, neonatal specimens, infants, or children. assay performance characteristics have not been established when the advia centaur hbc igm assay is used in conjunction with other manufacturers' assays for specific hbv serological markers. advia centaur hbc igm quality control materials on the centaur cp analyzer: for monitoring the performance of the hbc igm assay using the advia centaursystems. the performance of the hbc igm quality control material has not beenestablished with any other anti-hbc igm assays.
