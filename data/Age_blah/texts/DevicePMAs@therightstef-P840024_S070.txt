Approval to implement a design change to the two-pin socket on the headset microphone.  The transmitting coil is connected to the microphone via a cable which is plugged into this two-pinc socket.  This change would also entail making a slight modification to the design of the shell of the headset microphone in order to accommodate the new design of the two-pin socket.
