Approval of the PROPEL Contour Sinus Implant.  This device is indicated for use in patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age to maintain patency of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia following sinus surgery and locally deliver steroids to the sinus mucosa. The PROPEL Contour Sinus Implant separates/dilates mucosal tissues, prevents obstruction by adhesions/scarring, and reduces edema.  The implant reduces the need for post-operative intervention such as surgical adhesion lysis and/or use of oral steroids.
