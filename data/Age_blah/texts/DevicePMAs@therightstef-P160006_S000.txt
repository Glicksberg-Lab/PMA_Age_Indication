Approval for the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay. This device is indicated for the following: VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 intended for use in the assessment of the PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) urothelial carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue stained with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit and OptiView Amplification Kit on a VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument. Determination of PD-L1 status is indication-specific, and evaluation is based on either the proportion of tumor area occupied by PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity or the percentage of PD-L1 expressing tumor cells (% TC) of any intensity. PD-L1 expression in 5% IC determined by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay in urothelial carcinoma tissue is associated with increased objective response rate (ORR) in a non-randomized study of TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab).PD-L1 expression in 50% TC or 10% IC as detected by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay in NSCLC may be associated with enhanced overall survival from TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab).
