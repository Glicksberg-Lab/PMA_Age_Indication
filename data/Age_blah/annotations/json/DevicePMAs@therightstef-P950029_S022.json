The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name symphony dr 2550 and is indicated for: 1) rate adaptive pacing in patients who may benefit from increased pacing rates concurrent with increases in minute ventilation and/or activity.  2) the accepted patient conditions warranting chronic cardiac pacing which include, but are not restricted to: symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent second or third-degree av block, symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block, symptomatic paroxysmal or transient sinus node dysfunctions with or without associated av conduction disorders, bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome to prevent symptomatic bradycardia or some forms of symptomatic tachyarrhythmias and vasovagal syndromes or hypersensitive carotid sinus syndromes.  In addition, the dual-chamber and atrial tracking modes is indicated for patients who may benefit from maintenance of av synchrony.  Dual-chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of conduction disorders that require restoration of both rate and av synchrony which include: various degrees of av block to maintain the atrial contribution to cardiac output and vvi intolerance (e. g., pacemaker syndrome) in the presence of persistent sinus rhythm.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
