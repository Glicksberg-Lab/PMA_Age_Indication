Defined EGFR mutations are detected using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPET) or circulating-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) from plasma derived from EDTA anti-coagulated peripheral whole blood. The test is indicated as a companion diagnostic to aid in selecting NSCLC patients for treatment with the targeted therapies listed in Table 1 below in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling: Table 1Drug                     FFPET\t                           PlasmaTARCEVA (erlotinib)\t Exon 19 deletions and L858R\tExon 19 deletions and L858RTAGRISSO  (osimertinib) 790M        T790M*Patients with positive cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 test results using plasma specimens for the presence of the EGFR mutations listed above are eligible for treatment with the corresponding drug as indicated in Table 1 (see Note* for T790M). Patients who are negative for these mutations by this test should be reflexed to routine biopsy and testing for EGFR mutations with the FFPET sample type.  *The efficacy of TAGRISSO (osimertinib) has not been established in the EGFR T790M plasma-positive, tissue-negative or unknown population and clinical data for T790M plasma-positive patients are limited; therefore, testing using plasma specimens is most appropriate for consideration in patients from whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained. Drug safety and efficacy have not been established for the EGFR mutations listed in Table 2 below that are also detected by the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2:  Table 2Drug\t               FFPET                                             PlasmaTARCEVA (erlotinib) G719X, exon 20 insertions, T790M, S768I and L861Q   G719X, exon 20 insertions, T790M, S768I and L861QTAGRISSO (osimertinib)\tG719X, exon 19 deletions, L858R, exon 20 insertions, S768I, and L861Q     G719X, exon 19 deletions, L858R, exon 20 insertions,  S768I, and L861QFor manual sample preparation, FFPET specimens are processed using the cobas DNA Sample Preparation Kit and plasma specimens are processed using the cobas cfDNA Sample Preparation Kit. The cobas z 480 analyzer is used for automated amplification and detection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
