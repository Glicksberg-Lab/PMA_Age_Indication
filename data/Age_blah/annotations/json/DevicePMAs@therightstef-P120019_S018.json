{"sourcedb":"DevicePMAs@therightstef","sourceid":"P120019_S018","text":"The cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 is a real-time PCR test for the qualitative detection of defined mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Defined EGFR mutations are detected using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPET) or circulating-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) from plasma derived from EDTA anti-coagulated peripheral whole blood. The test is indicated as a companion diagnostic to aid in selecting NSCLC patients for treatment with the targeted therapies listed in Table 1 below in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling: Table 1 Drug\t                                FFPET\t                                              PlasmaTARCEVA (erlotinib)\t        Exon 19 deletions and L858R\t              Exon 19 deletions and L858RTAGRISSO (osimertinib)\tExon 19 deletions, L858R and T790M\t      Exon 19 deletions, L858R and T790M*Patients with positive cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 test results using plasma specimens for the presence of the EGFR mutations listed above are eligible for treatment with the corresponding drug as indicated in Table 1 (see Note* for T790M). Patients who are negative for these mutations by this test using plasma specimens should be reflexed to routine biopsy and testing for EGFR mutations with the FFPET sample type.*The efficacy of TAGRISSO (osimertinib) has not been established in the EGFR T790M plasma-positive, tissue-negative or unknown population and clinical data for T790M plasma-positive patients are limited; therefore testing using plasma specimens is most appropriate for consideration in patients from whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained.

The cobas z 480 analyzer is used for automated amplification and detection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
