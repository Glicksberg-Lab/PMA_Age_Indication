Assay results, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to provide presumptive evidence of infection with the hepatitis b virus (hbv) (state of infection or associated disease not determined) in persons with signs and symptoms of  hepatitis and in persons at risk for hepatitis b infection.  Not intended for use in screening blood, plasma, or tissue donors. architect hbsag qualitative confirmatory - the architect hbsag qualitative confirmatory assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (cmia) for the qualitative confirmation of the presence of hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in human adult and pediatric serum and plasma and neonate serum by means of specific antibody neutralization. assay results, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, may be used to provide presumptive evidence of infection with the hepatitis b virus (hbv) (state of infection or associated disease not determined) in persons with signs and symptoms of hepatitis and in persons at risk for hepatitis b infection.
