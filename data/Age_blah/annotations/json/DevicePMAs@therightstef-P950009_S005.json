The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name focalpoint system.  The focalpoint system (autopap primary screening system) is indicated for:  the focalpoint system is an automated cervicel cytology screening device intended for use in initial screening of cervical cytology clides.  The focalpoint system identifies up to 25% of successfully processed slides as requiring no further review.  The focalpoint system also identifies at least 15% of all successfully processed slides for a second manual review.  The device is intended to be used on both conventionally-prepared and prepstain system cervical cytology slides.  For both preparation methods, the device is intended to detect slides with evidence of squamous carcinoma and adenocarconoma and their usual precursor conditions; it is not intended to be used on slides designated by the laboratory as high risk.  Intended users are trained cytology laboratory personnel operating under the direct supervision of a qualified cytology supervisor or laboratory manager/director.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
