Dual-chamber pacing is indicated for those patients exhibiting:  1) sick sinus syndrome  2) chronic, symptomatic second- and third degree av block  3) recurrent adams-stokes syndrome  4) symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block when tachyarrhythmia and other causes have been ruled out.  Atrial pacing is indicated for patients with sinus node dysfunction and normal av and intraventricular conduction systems.  Ventricular pacing is indicated for patients with significant bradycardia and:  1) normal sinus rhythm with only rare episodes of av block or sinus arrest  2) chronic atrial fibrillation  3) severe physical disability.  Dynamic atrial overdrive is indicated for suppression of atrial tachyarrhythmias including paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation episodes in patients with one or more of the above pacing indications.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
