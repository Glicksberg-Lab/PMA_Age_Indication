The devices, as modified, will be marketed under the trade names physio-stim models 3202, 3302, 3313, 3314, 3315 andspinal-stim model 2212.  The physio-stim models are indicated for the treatment of an established nonunion acquired secondary to trauma, excluding vertebrae and all flat bones, where the width of the nonunion defects is less than one-half the width of the bone to be treated.  A nonunion is considered to be established when the fracture site shows no visibly progressive signs of healing.  The spinal-stim is a noninvasive electromagnetic bone growth stimulator indicated as a spinal fusion adjunct to increase the probability of fusion success and as a nonoperative treatment for salvage of failed spinal fusion, where a minimum of nine months has elapsed since last surgery.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
