The zenith fenestrated aaa endovascular graft is indicated for the endovascular treatment ofpatients with abdominal aortic or aortoiliac aneurysms having morphology suitable for endovascular repair, including: 1) adequate iliac/femoral access compatible with required introduction systems; 2) nonaneurysmal infrarenal aortic segment (neck) proximal to the aneurysms with: a) length \u003E= 4 mm and unsuitable for a non-fenestrated graft. b) diameter \u003C= 31 mm and \u003E= 19 mm. c) angle \u003C 45 degrees relative to long axis of aneurysm. d) angle \u003C 45 degrees relative to axis of suprarenal aorta.  3) ipsilateral iliac artery fixation site \u003E 30 mm in length and between 9 - 21 mm in diameter; and contralateral iliac artery distal fixation site \u003E 30 mm in length and between 7 - 21 mm in diameter.  The zenith alignment stent is indicated for use as an adjunct to the zenith fenestrated aaaendovascular graft to secure positive alignment of fenestrations or scallops with the orifice of aortic branch vessels having diameters ranging from 3 to 8 mm.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
