Collagraft strip bone graft matrix (collagraft) was originally approved by the fda on january 27, 1994 (review of p900039).  The product currently continues to be marketed by that name.  Neugraft is identical to collagraft strip bone graft matrix, except that the brand name on the labeling is different.  The labeling for neugraft indicated and explains that the two products are the same, but are sold through different distribution channels.  As proposed, the product will continue to be sold using both names collagraft and neugraft.  There will be no change affecting safety and effectiveness for this product.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
