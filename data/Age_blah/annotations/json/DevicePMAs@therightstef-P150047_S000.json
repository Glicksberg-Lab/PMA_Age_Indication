Defined EGFR mutations are detected using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPET) or circulating-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) from plasma derived from EDTA anti-coagulated peripheral whole blood. The test is indicated as a companion diagnostic to aid in selecting NSCLC patients for treatment with the targeted therapies listed in Table 1 below in accordance with the approved therapeutic product labeling.

Patients who are negative for these mutations by this test should be reflexed to routine biopsy and testing for EGFR mutations with the FFPET sample type. Drug safety and efficacy have not been established for the EGFR mutations listed in Table 2 below that are also detected by the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2.

The cobas z 480 analyzer is used for automated amplification and detection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
