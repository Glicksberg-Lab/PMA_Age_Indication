The device is indicated for the following:  the sts-7 continuous glucose monitoring system (sts-7 system) is a glucose-monitoring device indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in adults (age 18 and older) with diabetes.  The sts-7 system is intended for use by patients at home and in health care facilities.  The device is for prescription use only.  The sts-7 continuous glucose monitoring system is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices.  The sts-7 continuous glucose monitoring system aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these excursions.  Interpretation of the sts-7 system results should be based on the trends and patterns seen with several sequential readings over time.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":289,"end":294},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":282,"end":284},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":282,"end":294},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":270,"end":276},"obj":"age_category"}]}
