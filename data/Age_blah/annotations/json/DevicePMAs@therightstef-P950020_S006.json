The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name cutting balloon monorail/otw and is indicated for dilatation of stenoses in coronary arteries for the purpose of improving myocardial perfusion in those circumstances where a high pressure balloon resistant lesion is encountered.  In addition, the target lesion should posses the following characteristics: discrete (\u003C= 15 mm in length) or tubular (10 to 20 mm in length); with a reference vessel diameter ranging from 2.0 mm to 4.0 mm; readily accessible to the device; light to moderate tortuosity of proximal vessel segment, non-angulated lesion segment (\u003C 45 degrees), smooth angiographic contour; and absence of angiographically-visible thrombus and/or calcification.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
