The electrochemilumi-nescence immunoassay ?eclia? is intended for use on the roche elecsys 2010 and modular analytics e170 (elecsys module) immunoassay analyzers.  The elecsys hbsag confirmatory test - for the in vitro qualitative confirmation of the presence of hepatitis b surface antigen in human serum and plasma (sodium heparin, edta-k3, sodium citrate) samples repeatedly reactive when tested with the elecsys hbsag immunoassay. the elecsys hbsag confirmatory immunoassay is intended for use on the roche elecsys 2010 and modular analytics e170 immunoassay analyzers.  Elecsys precicontrol hbsag - for quality control of the elecsys hbsag immunoassay on the elecsys 2010 and modular analytics e170 analyzers when testing human serum. the performance of the precicontrol hbsag has not been established with any other hbsag assay.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
