The MTD Test is indicated for the direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex rRNA in evaluating AFB smear positive sediments prepared using NALC-NaOH digestion-decontamination of respiratory specimens from untreated patients suspected of having tuberculosis.  Patients who have received no anti-tuberculous therapy, less than 7 days of such therapy, or have not received such therapy in the last 12 months may be evaluated with this test.  The MTD test should be performed only in laboratories proficient in the culture and identification of M. tuberculosis (Level II and III, or extent 3 and 4 laboratories).  The MTD should always be performed in conjuction with mycobacterial culture.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
