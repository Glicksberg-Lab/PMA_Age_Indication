In addition, the target lesion should possess the fillowing characteristics: discrete (\u003C=15 mm in length) or tubular (10 to 20 mm in length) with a reference vessel diameter ranging from 2.0 mm to 4.0 mm; readily accessible to the device; light to moderate tortuosity of proximal vessel segment, non-angulated lesion segment (\u003C45 degrees), smooth angiographic contour; and absence of angiographically-visible thrombus and/or calcification.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
