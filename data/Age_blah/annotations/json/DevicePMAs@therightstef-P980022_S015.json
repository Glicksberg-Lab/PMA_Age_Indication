The guardian real-time system is indicated for continuous or periodic monitoring of glucose levels in the fluid under the skin, in adults, age 18 and over, and in children and adolescents, age 7 to 17, with diabetes mellitus, for the purpose of improving diabetes management.  It alerts if a glucose level falls below, or rises above, preset values.  Values are not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a fingerstick may be required. all therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor.  The system provides real-time glucose values that allow users to track patterns in glucose concentrations and to possibly identify episodes of low and high blood glucose.  It also stores the data so that it can be analyzed to track patterns.  Glucose data can be further downloaded to pc software for analysis of historical glucose values.  The paradigm real-time system is indicated for continuous or periodic monitoring of glucose levels in the fluid under the skin, and possible low and high blood glucose episodes in adults, age 18 and over, and in children and adolescents, age 7 through 17.  The system provides an alert if glucose levels fall below or rise above preset values.  Glucose values provided by the system are not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a fingerstick may be required.  All therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor and not on sensor glucose readings provided by the paradigm real-time system.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1228},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1194},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":267,"end":269},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":262,"end":263},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":262,"end":269},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":245,"end":256},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":232,"end":240},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":212,"end":223},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1211},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":219,"end":223},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1202},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":212,"end":214},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1260,"end":1262},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1251},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1262},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1211},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1233,"end":1244},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":200,"end":206},"obj":"age_category"}]}
