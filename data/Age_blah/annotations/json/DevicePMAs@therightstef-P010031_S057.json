The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name medtronic concerto models c154dwk and c164awk icd systems and is indicated as follow:  the concerto is indicated for ventricular antitachycardia pacing and ventricular defibrillation for automated treatment of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. in addition, the device is indicated for use in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias, or those patients who are at significant risk of developing atrial tachyarrhythmias.  The system is also indicated for the reduction of the symptoms of moderate to severe heart failure (nyha functional class iii or iv) in those patients who remain symptomatic despite stable, optimal medical therapy and have a left ventricular ejection fraction # 35% and a prolonged qrs duration.  Atrial rhythm management features such as atrial rate stabilization (ars), atrial preference pacing (app), and post mode switch overdrive pacing (pmop) are indicated for the suppression of atrial tachyarrhythmias in icd-indicated patients with atrial septal lead placement and an icd indication.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
