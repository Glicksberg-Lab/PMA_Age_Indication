The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name Actros Pacing System which consists of the following: Actros DR, D, SR, and S models, PMS 1000 C programmers, SWM 1000 (Version F03.B00.U).  Rate adaptive pacing with the Actros DR and Actros SR pulse generators is indicated for patients exhibiting chronotropic incompetence and who would benefit from increased pacing rates concurrent with physical activity.  Generally accepted indications for long-term cardiac pacing include, but not limited to: sick sinus syndrome (i. e., bradycardiatachcardia syndrome, sinus arrest, sinus bradycardia), sino-atrial (SA) block, second- and third- degree AV block, and carotid sinus syndrome.  Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic benefit through maintenance of AV synchrony should be considered for one of the dual-chamber or atrial pacing modes.  Dual-chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of conduction disorders that require both restoration of rate and AV synchrony such as AV nodal disease, diminished cardiac output or congestive heart failure associated with conduction disturbances, and tachyarrhythmias that are suppressed by chronic pacing.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
