The Praxis Extended RAS Panel is indicated to aid in the identification of patients with colorectal cancer for treatment with Vectibix (panitumumab) based on a no mutation detected test result. The test is intended to be used on the Illumina MiSeqDx instrument.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
