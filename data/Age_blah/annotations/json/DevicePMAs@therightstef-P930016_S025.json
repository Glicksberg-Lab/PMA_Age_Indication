The device used a 6.0 mm optical zone, an 8.0 mm treatment zone, and is indicated for wavefront-guided (wfg) laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (lasik) to achieve monovision by the targeted retention of myopia (-1.25 to -2.00 d) in the non-dominant eye of presbyopic myopes: 1) 40 years or older who may benefit from increased spectacle independence across a range of distances with useful near vision; 2) with myopic astigmatism up to -6.00 d mrse, with cylinder up to -3.00 d, and minimum pre-operative myopia in their non-dominant eye at least as great as their targeted myopia; 3) with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of no more than 0.50 d (in both cylinder and sphere components) for at least one year prior to the date of pre-operative examination; and 4) with a successful pre-operative trial of monovision or history of monovision experience.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
