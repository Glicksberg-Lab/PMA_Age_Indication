The animas vibe systems continuous glucose monitoring (cgm) is indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons (age 2 and older) with diabetes, and is intended to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices. cgm aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these excursions. interpretation of results from the dexcom g4 platinum sensor and transmitter should be based on the trends and patterns seen with several sequential readings over time. the animas vibe system is intended for single patient use in persons age 2 and older and requires a prescription.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1195,"end":1200},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1189,"end":1190},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1189,"end":1200},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":644,"end":649},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":638,"end":639},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":638,"end":649},"obj":"age_range"}]}
