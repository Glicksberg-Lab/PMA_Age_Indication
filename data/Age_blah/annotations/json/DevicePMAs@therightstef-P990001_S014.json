The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name medtronic/vitatron da+ c-series implantable generators and is indicated as follows:   1)   dual chamber pacing is indicated if av synchrony needs to be restored in order to optimize cardiac output. for example, patients with symptomatic second or third degree av block.  2) dual chamber rate responsive pacing modes are of specific benefit to patients with chronotropic incompetence of the sinus node.  3) rate responsive modes can help patients who have a requirement for anincrease in pacing rate in response to physical activity. 4) single chamber ventricular pacing can help patients with permanent atrialtachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and flutter.  5) single chamber atrial pacing can help patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmiasand normal av conduction.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
