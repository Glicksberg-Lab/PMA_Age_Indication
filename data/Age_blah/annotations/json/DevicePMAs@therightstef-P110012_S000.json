The test is for prescription use only. the vysis paraffin pretreatment iv \u0026 post hybridization wash buffer kit is used to prepare paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue sections fixed on positively charged slides for use in fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) with vysis dna fish probes. the probechek alk negative control slides are intended for use as an assay control for appropriate hybridization conditions during routine use of the vysis alk break apart fish probe kit (list no. 06n38-020). the probechek alk negative control slides should be assayed in conjunction with the user's specimen slides according the package insert for the vysis alk break apart fish probe kit (list no. 06n38-020). the probechek alk positive control slides are intended for use as an assay control for appropriate hybridization conditions during routine use of the vysis alk break apart fish probe kit (list no. 06n38-020). the probechek alk positive control slides should be assayed in conjunction with the user's specimen slides according the package insert for the vysis alk break apart fish probe kit (list no. 06n38-020).","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
