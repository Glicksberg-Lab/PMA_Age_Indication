The device is indicated for: top2a fish pharmdx kit is designed to detect amplifications and deletions (copy number changes) of the top2a gene using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) technique on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens.  Deletions and amplifications of the top2a gene serve as a marker for poor prognosis in high-risk breast cancer patients.  Results from the top2a fish pharmdx kit are intended for use as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathological information.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
