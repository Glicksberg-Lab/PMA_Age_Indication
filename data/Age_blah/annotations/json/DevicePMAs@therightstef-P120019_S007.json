Drug safety and efficacy have not been established for the following egfr mutations also detected by the cobas egfr mutation test v2: tarceva (erlotinib)/g719x, exon 20 insertions, t790m, s768i and l861q/tagrisso (osimertinib)/g719x, exon 19 deletions, l858r, exon 20 insertions, s768i, and l861q.  For manual sample preparation, ffpet specimens are processed using the cobas dna sample preparation kit and the cobas z 480 analyzer is used for automated amplification and detection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
