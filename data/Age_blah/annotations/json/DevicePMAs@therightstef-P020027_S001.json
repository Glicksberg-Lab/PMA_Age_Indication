The device, as modified, will be marketed under the same trade name, dimension fpsa flex reagent cartridge and is indicated as follows:  the fpsa method for the dimension clinical chemistry system with the heterogenous immunoassay module is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to quantitatively measure free prostate specific antigen (fpsa) in human serum and plasma.  Measurements of fpsa are used in conjunction with total psa (tpsa) on the dimension system to calculate fpsa to tpsa ratio expressed as percent fpsa.  The percent fpsa is used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostate conditions in men 50 years or older with tpsa of 4.0 to 10/0 ng/ml (ug/l) and digital rectal examination (dre) findings not suspicious for cancer.  Prostate biopsy is required for diagnosis of prostate cancer.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
