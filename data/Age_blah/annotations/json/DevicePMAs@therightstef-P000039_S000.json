The amplatzer septal occluder (aso) device is indicated for the occlusion of atrial septal defects (asd) in secundum position.  The aso device is also indicated in patients who have undergone a fenestrated fontan procedure and who now require closure of the fenestration.  Patients indicated for asd closure have echocardiographic evidence of ostium secundum atrial septal defect and clinical evidence of right ventricular volume overload (i. e., 1.5:1 degree of left to right shunt or rv enlargement).  The amplatzer exchange system is intended for the removal of an amplatzer delivery sheath and subsequent exchange for an amplatzer delivery sheath of equal or larger diameter.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
