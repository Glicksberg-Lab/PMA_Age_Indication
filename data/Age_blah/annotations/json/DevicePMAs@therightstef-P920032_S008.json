The device is indicated for \"any clinical situation  in which the use of temporary pacemaker on a patient provides therapeutic or diagnostic value, or serves a prophylactic purpose.  Specifically, indications for temporary pacemakers include, but are not limited to, the following:  intermittent or complete heart block associated with asystole or bradycardia, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, surgically-induced heart block and heart block accompanying an acute myocardial infarction.  Additionally, temporary cardiac pacing has been used to overdrive and thereby terminate atrial arrhythmias, including atrial flutter.  It has been used in preparation for permanent pacemaker implantation to ascertain the thresholds for sensing and pacing on the acute lead system.\"","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
