The transmitting coil is connected to the microphone via a cable which is plugged into this two-pinc socket.  This change would also entail making a slight modification to the design of the shell of the headset microphone in order to accommodate the new design of the two-pin socket.  The nucleus 22 channel cochlear implant is indicated for use in adults with bilateral, sensorineural, severe-to-profound deafness, ages 18 years and older, who obtain up to 30% speech recognition on tests of recorded sentence materials in the best-aided condition.  It is indicated for use in children with bilateral, sensorineural, profound deafness, ages 2 years to 17 years, who obtain little or not benefit from conventional amplification in the best-aided test condition.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":730,"end":749},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":666,"end":674},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":509,"end":511},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":512,"end":517},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":522,"end":527},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":509,"end":527},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":437,"end":443},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":730,"end":731},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":741,"end":743},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":744,"end":749},"obj":"age_end_unit"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":732,"end":737},"obj":"age_start_unit"}]}
