The pulsar/pulsar  max series pacemakers' dual chamber and atrial tracking modes are also indicated for patients who may benefit from maintenance of av synchrony. \tdual chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of the following: conduction disorders that require restoration of av synchrony, including varying degrees of \tav block vvi intolerance (e. g., pacemaker syndrome) in the presence of persistent sinus rhythm low cardiac output or congestive heart failure secondary to bradycardia.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
