{"sourcedb":"DevicePMAs@therightstef","sourceid":"P160037_S000","text":"Approval for the BD Onclarity HPV Assay. The BD Onclarity HPV Assay is a qualitative in vitro test for the detection of Human Papillomavirus in cervical specimens collected by a clinician using an endocervical brush/spatula combination or broom and placed in BD SurePath vial. The test utilizes amplification of target DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid hybridization for the detection of 14 high-risk (HR) HPV types in a single analysis. The test specifically identifies types 16, 18 and 45 while concurrently detecting the other HR HPV types that include 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68. The BD Onclarity HPV Assay is indicated: 1) In women 21 years and older with ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) cervical cytology test results, the BD Onclarity HPV Assay can be used to determine the need for referral to colposcopy; 2) In women 21 years and older with ASC-US cervical cytology test results, the BD Onclarity HPV assay can be used to detect high-risk HPV genotypes 16, 18 and 45.  This information together with physicians assessment of screening history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines, may be used to guide patient management.  The results of this test are not intended to prevent women from proceeding to colposcopy; 3) In women 30 years and older, the BD Onclarity HPV Assay can be used together with cervical cytology to adjunctively screen to detect high risk HPV types.  This information, together with the physicians assessment of screening history, other factors, and professional guidelines, may be used to guide patient management; 4) In women 30 years and older, the BD Onclarity HPV Assay can be used to detect high-risk HPV genotypes 16, 18 and 45.  This information, together with the physicians assessment of screening history, other factors, and professional guidelines, may be used to guide patient management; and5) In women 25 years and older, the BD Onclarity HPV Assay can be used as a first-line primary cervical cancer screening test to detect high risk HPV, including 16 and 18.  Women who test negative for the high risk HPV types by the BD Onclarity HPV Assay should be followed up in accordance with the physicians assessment of screening and medical history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines.  Women who test positive for HPV genotypes 16 and/or 18 by the BD Onclarity HPV Assay should be referred to colposcopy.  Women who test high risk HPV positive and 16 and 18 negative by the BD Onclarity HPV Assay (12 other HR HPV Positive) should be evaluated by cervical cytology to determine the need for referral to colposcopy.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1929,"end":1931},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1929,"end":1947},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1942,"end":1947},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1642},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1319},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1658},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1335},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1335},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":897,"end":899},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":678,"end":680},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1932,"end":1937},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1643,"end":1648},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1325},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":681,"end":686},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":678,"end":696},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":897,"end":915},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":910,"end":915},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":691,"end":696},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1653,"end":1658},"obj":"age_end"}]}
