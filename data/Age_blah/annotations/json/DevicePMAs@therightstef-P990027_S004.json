{"sourcedb":"DevicePMAs@therightstef","sourceid":"P990027_S004","text":"Approval for the technolas 217a excimer laser system.  The device uses an optical zone treatment range from 5.00 mm to 6.00 mm with a blend zone of 1.90 mm for spherical hyperopia and 1.75 mm for hyperopic astigmatism.  The laser is locked out for refractive corrections greater than +4.00 d sphere and greater than +2.00 d cylinder.  The device is indicated for laser in-situ keratomileusis (lasik) treatments:  1) for the reduction or elimination of low-to-moderate naturally occurring hyperopia up to +4.00 diopters (d) mrse, with sphere between +1.00 to +4,00 d with or without refractive astigmatism up to +2.00 d at the spectacle plane;  2) in patients who are 21 years of age or older; and,  3) in patients with documented evidence of a change in manifest refraction of less than or equal to 0.50 diopters (in both cylinder and sphere components) for at least one year prior to the date of the pre-operative examination.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":686,"end":691},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":670,"end":675},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":667,"end":669},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":667,"end":691},"obj":"age_range"}]}
