The device is indicated for use in patients with a history of hemodynamically compromising ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  These patients may have experienced a cardiac arrest not associated with acute myocardial infarction or have ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  In addition, the pulse generator can be used in patients whose primary therapy for hemodynamically significant, sustained ventricular tachycardia is antitachycardia pacing; the defibrillation capabilities of the device provide high-energy therapy in the event that the arrhythmia accelerates.  The pulse generator can be implanted in either the pectoral region or the abdominal region, at the physician's discretion.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
