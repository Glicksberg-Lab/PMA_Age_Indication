The device is indicated for use in the ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation, in the presence of the photoactive drug methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen or 8-MOP), of extracorporeally circulating leukocyte-enriched blood, in the palliative treatment of the skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), in persons who have not been responsive to other therapy.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
