PD-L1 protein expression is defined as the percentage of evaluable tumor cells exhibiting partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity.  PD-L1 expression as detected by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in non-squamous NSCLC may be associated with enhanced survival from OPDIVO (nivolumab).  Positive PD-L1 status as determined by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in melanoma is correlated with the magnitude of the treatment effect on progression-free survival from OPDIVO.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
