The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name quantiferon - tb gold in-tube and is indicated for use as an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating esat-6, cfp-10 and tb 7.7(p4) proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood drawn directly into specialized blood collection tubes.  Detection of interferon-y by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) is used to identify in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
