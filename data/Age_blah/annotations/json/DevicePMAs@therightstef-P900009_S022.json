The exogen 4000+ is modified to incorporate user-interface modifications and design modifications to compensate for changes in electronic component availability.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name exogen 4000+ bone healing system.  The exogen 4000+ is indicated for the non-invasive treatment of established non-unions excluding skull and vertebra.  In addition, it is indicated for accelerating the time to a healed fracture, for fresh, closed, posteriorly displaced distal radius fractures and fresh, closed or grade i open tibial diaphysis fractures in skeletally mature individuals when these fractures are orthopaedically managed by closed reduction and cast immobilization.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
