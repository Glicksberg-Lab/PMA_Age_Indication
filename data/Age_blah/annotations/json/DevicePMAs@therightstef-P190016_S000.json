This device is intended to create a myringotomy and insert a tympanostomy tube using the Tula Tube Delivery System in pediatric (aged 6 months and older) and adult patients indicated to receive tympanostomy tubes. The Tula System is used to deliver a tympanostomy tube under local anesthesia induced using the Tula Iontophoresis System and TYMBION, a combination of an amide local anesthetic and an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist. TYMBION, a combination of an amide local anesthetic and an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist, is indicated for the induction of local anesthesia of the tympanic membrane via iontophoresis using the Tula Iontophoresis System in pediatric (aged 6 months and older) and adult patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement using the Tula Tube Delivery SystemDrug Indications and Usage:  TYMBION, a combination of an amide local anesthetic and an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist, is indicated for the induction of local anesthesia of the tympanic membrane via iontophoresis using the Tula Iontophoresis System in pediatric (aged 6 months and older) and adult patients undergoing tympanostomy tube placement using the Tula Tube Delivery System.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1125},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1109,"end":1114},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1104},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1097},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1114},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1089},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":734,"end":739},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":723,"end":728},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":712,"end":718},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":710,"end":711},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":710,"end":728},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":694,"end":703},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":189,"end":194},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":178,"end":183},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":167,"end":173},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":165,"end":166},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":165,"end":183},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":149,"end":158},"obj":"age_category"}]}
