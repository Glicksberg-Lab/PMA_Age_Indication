The Oncor(R) INFORM(TM) HER-2/neu Gene Detection System is a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) DNA probe assay that determines the qualitative presence of HER-2/neu gene amplification on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast tissue as an aid to stratify breast cancer patients according to risk for recurrence or disease-related death.  It is indicated for use as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathologic information currently used as prognostic indicators in the risk stratification of breast cancer in patients who have had a priary, invasive, localized breast carcinoma and who are lymph node-negative.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
