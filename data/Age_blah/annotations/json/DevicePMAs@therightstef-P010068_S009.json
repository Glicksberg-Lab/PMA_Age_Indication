The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name navistar rmt ds diagnostic/ablation deflectable 8mm tip catheter and is indicated for catheter-based atrial and ventricular electrophysiologic mapping (stimulation and recording), and when used with the stockert 70 radiofrequency generator (with software version 001/033 or higher) for the treatment of type i atrial flutter in patients 18 or older.  The navistar rmt ds catheter provides location information when used with the carto rmt ep navigation system.  The navistar rmt ds diagnostic/ablation steerable catheter is only for use with the stereotaxis magnetic navigation system (mns).  Compatibility with the stereotaxis cardiodrive has not been determined.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
