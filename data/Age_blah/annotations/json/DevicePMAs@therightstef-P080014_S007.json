The cervista hpv hr test uses the invader chemistry, a signal amplification method for detection of specific nucleic acid sequences. this method uses two types of isothermal reactions:  a primary reaction that occurs on the targeted dna sequence and a secondary reaction that produces a fluorescent signal. the cervista hpv hr test is indicated: 1) to screen patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ascus) cervical cytology results to determine the need for referral to colostomy; and 2) in women 30 years and older the cervista hpv hr test can be used with cervical cytology to adjunctively screen to assess the presence or absence of high-risk hpv types. this information, together with the physician's assessment of cytology history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines, may be used to guide patient management.  Cervical specimens that may be tested with the cervista hpv hr test include the following preservation system collection media and collection devices: thinprep pap test preservcyt solution broom-type device (e. g., rovers cervex brush, wallach papette), or endocervical brush/spatula. the cervista hpv hr test may be performed either manually or using the automated cervista high-throughput automation system.
