The aptima hpv 16 18/45 genotype assay can differentiate hpv 16 from hpv 18 and/or hpv 45, but does not differentiate between hpv 18 and hpv 45. cervical specimens in thinprep pap test vials containing preservcyt solution and collected with broom-type orcytobrush/spatula collection devices* may be tested with the aptima hpv 16 18/45 genotype assay. the assay is used with the tigris dts system.  The use of the test is indicated:  1) in patients 21 years and older with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance(asc-us) cervical cytology results, the aptima hpv 16 18/45 genotype assay can be used to test samples from women with aptima hpv assay positive results to assess the presence or absence of high-risk hpv genotypes 16, 18, and/or 45. this information, together with the physician's assessment of cytology history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines, may be used to guide patient management. the results of this test are not intended to prevent women from proceeding to colposcopy; and 2) in women 30 years and older, the aptima hpv 16 18/45 genotype assay can be used to test samples from women with aptima hpv assay positive results. the assay results wi11 be used in combination with cervical cytology to assess the presence or absence of high-risk hpv genotypes 16, 18, and/or 45. this information, together with the physician's assessment of cytology history, other risk factors, and professional guidelines, may be used to guide patient management * broom-type device (e. g., wallach pipette), or endocervical brush/spatula.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
