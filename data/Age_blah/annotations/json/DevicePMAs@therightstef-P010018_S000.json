This device is indicated for:  temporary reduction of spherical hyperopia in patients who have 0.75 d to 3.25 d of cycloplegic spherical hyperopia, less than or equal to 0.75 d of refractive astigmatism (minus cylinder format), a cycloplegic spherical equivalent of 0.75 d to 3.00 d, and are 40 years of age or greater with a documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 month, as demonstrated by a change of less than 0.50 d in spherical and cylindrical components of the manifest refraction.  The magnitude of correction with this treatment diminishes over time, with some patients retaining some or all of their intended refractive correction.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":360,"end":367},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":344,"end":349},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":341,"end":343},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":341,"end":367},"obj":"age_range"}]}
