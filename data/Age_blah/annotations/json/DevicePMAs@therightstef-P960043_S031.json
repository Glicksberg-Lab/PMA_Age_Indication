The closer and the closer s 6 fr. smc systems are modified, as indicated for the percutaneous delivery of suture for closing the common femoral artery access site of patients who have undergone diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures using 5 to 8 fr. sheaths.  The closer and the closer s 6 fr. smc systems reduced the times to hemostasis, ambulation (10 feet) and discharge in patients who have undergone diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures without complicating clinical conditions (refer to precautions, special patient populations).","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
