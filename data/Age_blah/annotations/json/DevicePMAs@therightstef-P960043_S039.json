In addition, the labeling is being modified to include other healthcare professionals in the precaution on the limitation of use to physicians who have been trained in the use of this device.  The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name closer ak 6fr. suture-mediated closure (smc) system and is indicated for the percutaneous delivery of suture for closing the common femoral artery access site of patients who have undergone diagnostic or interventional catheterization procedures using 5 to 6 fr. sheaths.  The closer 6 fr. smc systems reduce the times to hemostasis, ambulation (10 feet) and discharge in patients who have undergone diagnostic and interventional catheterization procedures without complicating clinical conditions (refer to precautions, special patient populations).","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
