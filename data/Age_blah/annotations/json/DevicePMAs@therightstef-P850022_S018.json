The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade names orthopak non-invasive bone growth stimulator system and spinalpak non-invasive spine fusion stimulator system and are indicated for the following: 1) the biomet orthopak non-invasive bone growth stimulator system is indicated for the treatment of an established nonunion acquired secondary to trauma, excluding vertebrae and all flat bones, where the width of the nonunion defect is less than one-half the width of the bone to be treated.  A nonunion is considered to be established when the fracture site shows no visible progressive signs of healing; and  2) the biomet spinalpak non-invasive spine fusion stimulator system is indicated as an adjunct electrical treatment to primary lumbar spinal fusion surgery for one or two levels.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
