The lenses are indicated for use in the reduction of myopic refractive error in non-diseased eyes.  The lenses are indicated for overnight wear for the temporary reduction of myopia up to 5.00 diopters with eyes having astigmatism up to 1.50 diopters.  The lenses may only be disinfected using a chemical disinfection system.  Note: to maintain the orthokeratology effect of myopia reduction, overnight lens wear must be continued on a prescribed schedule.  Failure to do so can affect daily activities (e. g., night driving), visual fluctuations and changes in intended correction.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
