The cobas egfr mutation test is a real-time pcr test for the qualitative detection of exon 19 deletions and exon 21 (l858r) substitution mutations ofthe epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) gene in dna derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpet) human non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) tumor tissue. the test is intended to be used as an aid in selecting patients with metastatic nsclc for whom tarceva (erlotinib), an egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tk1), is indicated. specimens are processed using the cobas dna sample preparation kit for manual sample preparation and the cobas z 480 analyzer for automated amplification and detection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
