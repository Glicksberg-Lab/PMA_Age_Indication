The assay is used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information.  The assay may be used to test for hbv infection in pregnant women.  Axsym hbsag confirmatory: axsym hbsag confirmatory in s microparticle enzyme immunoassay (meia) intended for the confirmation of the presence of hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in neonatal serum, and adult and pediatric serum (including serum collected in serum separator tubes) or plasma (collected in potassium edta, sodium citrate, sodium heparin, lithium heparin, or plasma separator tubes).  The assay is used for confirmation of samples found to be repeatedly reactive by the axsym hbsag assay.  The assay may be used to confirm hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in pregnant woman.  Axsym hbsag controls: the axsym hbsag positive and negative controls are for use in monitoring the performance of the axsym hbsag reagent kit and the axsym hbsag confirmatory kit.  The performance of the axsym hbsag controls have not been established with any other hbsag assays.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
