These devices are indicated for:  immulite hbsag:  immulite hbsag is a solid-phased chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay designed for in vitro use with the immulite automated immunoassay analyzer for the qualitative detection of hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in human serum or plasma (edta, heparinized, citrate).  It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use for the laboratory diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis b virus infections in conjunction with other serological and clinical information.  In addition, this assay may be used to screen for hepatitis b infection in pregnant women to identify neonates who are at high risk of acquiring hbv during the perinatal period.  Immulite. 2000 hbsag: immulite 2000 hbsag is a solid-phase chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay designed for in vitro use with the immulite 2000 automated immunoassay analyzer for the qualitative detection of hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in human serum or plasma (edta, heparinized, citrate).
