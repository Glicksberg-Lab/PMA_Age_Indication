Measurements of fpsa are used in conjunction with total psa (tpsa) method on dimension vista systen to calculate fpsa to tpsa ratio expressed as a percent fpsa.  The percent fpsa is used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostate conditions in men 50  years or older with tpsa of 4.0 to 1.0 ng/ml and dre findings not suspicious for cancer.  Prostate biopsy is required for diagnosis of cancer.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
