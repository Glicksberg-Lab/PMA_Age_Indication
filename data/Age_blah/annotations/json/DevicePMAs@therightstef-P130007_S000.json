The system is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":666,"end":671},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":659,"end":661},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":659,"end":671},"obj":"age_range"}]}
