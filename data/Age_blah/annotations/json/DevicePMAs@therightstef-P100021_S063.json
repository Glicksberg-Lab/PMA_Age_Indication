{"sourcedb":"DevicePMAs@therightstef","sourceid":"P100021_S063","text":"Approval for the expansion of the indications for use of the Endurant II/Endurant IIs Stent Graft System to include the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms having neck lengths \u003E= 4 mm and \u003C 10 mm (short necks), when used in conjunction with the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System. The Endurant II/Endurant IIs bifurcated stent grafts are indicated for the endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic or aortoiliac aneurysms. They may be utilized in conjunction with the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System when augmented radial fixation and/or sealing is required; in particular, in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms with short (\u003E= 4 mm and \u003C 10 mm) infrarenal necks. The Endurant II aorto-uni-iliac (AUI) stent graft is indicated for the endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic or aortoiliac aneurysms in patients whose anatomy does not allow the use of a bifurcated stent graft. The Endurant II/Endurant IIs Stent Graft System is indicated for use in patients with the following characteristics: 1) Adequate iliac or femoral access that is compatible with vascular access techniques, devices, or accessories; 2) Proximal neck length of: \u003E=10 mm or \u003E= 4 and \u003C10 mm, when used in conjunction with the Heli-FX EndoAnchor System (bifurcated stent graft only) (Note: Neck length is defined as the length over which the aortic diameter remains within 10% of the infrarenal diameter); 3) Infrarenal neck angulation of \u003C= 60; 4) Aortic neck diameters with a range of 19 to 32 mm; 5) Distal fixation length(s) of \u003E= 15 mm; 6) Iliac diameters with a range of 8 to 25 mm; and 7) Morphology suitable for aneurysm repair.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
