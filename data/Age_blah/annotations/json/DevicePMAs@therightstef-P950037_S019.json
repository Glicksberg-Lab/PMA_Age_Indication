The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name home monitoring system, including model ba03 dddr pulse generator, model ruc 200 patient device, and model b-kt0.0.a programmer software, and is indicated for patients with the following conditions:  rate-adaptive pacing with the ba03 dddr pulse generators is indicated for patients exhibiting chronotropic incompetence and who would benefit from increased pacing rates concurrent with physical activity.  Generally accepted indications for long-term cardiac pacing include, but are not limited to:  sick sinus syndrome (i. e. bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, sinus arrest, sinus bradycardia), sino-atrial (sa) block, second- and third- degree av block, and carotid sinus syndrome. patients whom demonstrate hemodynamic benefit through maintenance of av synchrony should be considered for one of the dual-chamber or atrial pacing modes.  Dual-chamber modes are specifically indicted for treatment of conduction disorders that require both restoration of rate and av synchrony such as av nodal disease, diminished cardiac output or congestive heart failure associated with conduction disturbances, and tachyarrhythmias that are suppressed by chronic pacing.  Additional indications include: normal sinus rhythm and normal a-v conduction in patients who intermittently need ventricular pacing support.  Note: patients with known paroxysmal atrial...","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
