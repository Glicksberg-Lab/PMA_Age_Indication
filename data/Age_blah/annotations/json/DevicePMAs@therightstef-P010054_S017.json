The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade elecsys anti-hbs test system and is indicated for:  elecsys anti-hbs immunoassay -  immunoassay for the in vitro quantitative determination of total antibodies to the hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) in human serum and plasma (edta).  The electrochemiluminescence immunoassay \"eclia\" is intended for use on the roche elecsys 2010, modular analytics e170 (elecsys module), cobas e 411, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.  Assay results may be used as an aid in the determination of susceptibility to hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection for individuals prior to or following hbv vaccination, or where vaccination status is unknown.  Assay results may be used with other hbv serological markers for the laboratory diagnosis of hbv disease associated with hbv infection. a reactive assay result will allow a differential diagnosis in individuals displaying signs and symptoms of hepatitis in whom etiology is unknown. the detection of anti-hbs is indicative of laboratory diagnosis of seroconversion from hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
