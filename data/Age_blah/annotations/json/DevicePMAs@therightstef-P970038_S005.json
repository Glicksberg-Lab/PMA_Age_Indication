The device is indicated for:  the access hybritech free psa assay is a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of free prostate specific antigen (free psa) in human serum using the access immunoassay systems.  Access hybritech free psa is intended to be used with hybritech (total) psa to calculate the ratio of free psa to total psa expressed as a percentage (percent free psa).  Percent free psa as measured by the hybritech assays is indicated for use as an  aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic conditions, when used in conjunction with hybritech (total) psa for prostate cancer detection in men aged 50 years and older with total psa between 4 and 10 ng/ml with digital rectal examination findings that are not suspicious for cancer.  Prostatic biopsy is required for diagnosis of cancer.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":770,"end":775},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":760,"end":765},"obj":"age_start_unit"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":757,"end":759},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":757,"end":775},"obj":"age_range"}]}
