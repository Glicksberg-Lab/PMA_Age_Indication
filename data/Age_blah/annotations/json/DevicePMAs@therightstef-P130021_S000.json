This device is indicated for relief of aortic stenosis in patients with symptomatic heart disease due to severe native calcific aortic stenosis (aortic valve area ? 0.8 cm2, a mean aortic valve gradient of \u003E 40 mmHg, or a peak aortic-jet velocity of \u003E 4.0 m/s) and with native aortic annulus diameters between 18 and 29 mm who are judged by a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, to be at extreme risk or inoperable for open surgical therapy (predicted risk of operative mortality and/or serious irreversible morbidity ? 50% at 30 days).","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
