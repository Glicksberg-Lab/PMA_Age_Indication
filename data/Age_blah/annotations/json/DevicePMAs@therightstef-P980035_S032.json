The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name enpulse ipg and is indicated as follows:  enpulse pacemakers are indicated for use in patients who are experiencing accepted conditions warranting chronic cardiac pacing which include:  1) symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent second or third-degree av block  2) symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block  3) symptomatic paroxysmal or transient sinus node dysfunctions with or without associated av conduction disorders.  4) bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome  5) vasovagal syndromes or hypersensititve carotid sinus syndromes.  Enpulse pacemakers are also indicated for use in patients who may benefit from rate responsive pacing to support cardiac output during varying levels of activity.  Using rate response modes may restore heart rate variability by improving cardiac output.  These devices are also indicated for use in patients who may benefit from maintenance of av synchrony through the use of dual chamber modes and atrial tracking modes.  Dual chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of conduction disorders that require restoration of both rate and av synchrony.  Dual chamber modes are indicated for use in patients who have experienced one or both of the following conditions.  1) various degrees of av block  2) vvi intolerance (for example, pacemaker syndrome) in presence of persistent sinus rhythm.  The device is also indicated for vdd pacing in patients who have adequate rates and on or both of the following conditions.  1) a requirement for ventricular pacing when adequate atrial rates and adequate intracavitary atrial complexes are present.  This includes the presence of complete av block when atrial contribution is needed for hemodynamic benefit or when...","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
