The device is indicated for: elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay,  the elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay is intended for the in vitro qualitative determination of igm antibodies to hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc igm) in human serum or plasma (potassium edta, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, sodium citrate) in adult patients with symptoms of hepatitis or who may be at risk for hepatitis b (hbv) infection.  The presence of anti-hbc igm, in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information, is indicative of acute or recent hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection.  The elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassays performance has not been established for the monitoring of hbv disease or therapy. the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay eclia is intended for use on the cobas e 411 immuoassay analyzer. elecsys  precicontrol anti-hbc igm  - the elecsys precicontrol anti-hbc igm is used for the quality control of the elecsys anti-hbc igm immunoassay on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
