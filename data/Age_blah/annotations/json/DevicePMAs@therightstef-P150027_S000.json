Pd-l1 expression as detected by pd-l1 ihc pharmdx in nonsquamous nsclc may be associated with enhanced survival from opdivo (nivolumab).positive pd-l1 status as determined by pd-l1 ihc 28-8 pharmdx in melanoma is correlated with the magnitude of the treatment effect on progression-free survival from opdivo.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
