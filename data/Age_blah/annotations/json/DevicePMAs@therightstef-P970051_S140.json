The acoustic component is intended to provide access to these low frequency sounds for some Cochlear Nucleus implant recipients. The acoustic component is indicated for recipients of traditional Cochlear Nucleus implants with unaided air conduction thresholds less than or equal to 85 dB HL between 125 Hz and 2000 Hz following surgery. The acoustic component should only be used when behavioural audiometric thresholds can be obtained and the recipient can provide feedback regarding sound quality. Speech perception testing should be completed before and after fitting with the acoustic component to ensure that the recipient performs as well, if not better, with the acoustic component than without it.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
