The lens mitigates the effects of presbyopia by providing improved intermediate and near visual acuity, while maintaining comparable distance visual acuity with a reduced need for eyeglasses, compared to a monofocal IOL. Approval for the AcrySof IQ PanOptix Toric Trifocal Intraocular lens, which is indicated for primary implantation in the capsular bag in the posterior chamber of the eye for the visual correction of aphakia and the reduction of residual refractive astigmatism, in adult patients in whom a cataractous lens has been removed. The lens mitigates the effects of presbyopia by providing improved intermediate and near visual acuity, while maintaining comparable distance visual acuity with a reduced need for eyeglasses, compared to a monofocal IOL.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
