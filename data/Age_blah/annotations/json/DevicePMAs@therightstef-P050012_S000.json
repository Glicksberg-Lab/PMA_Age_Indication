The device is indicated for the following: 1) indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in adults (18 and older) with diabetes and is intended for use by patients at home and in health care facilities.  The device is for prescription use. 2) indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices. 3) aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these excursions.
