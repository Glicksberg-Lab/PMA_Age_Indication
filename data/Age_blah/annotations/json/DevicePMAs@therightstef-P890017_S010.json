The device is indicated for use in patients with atherosclerotic disease of the renal arteries following suboptimal percutaneous renal angioplasty (ptra) of a de novo or restenotic lesion (\u003C=22 mm in length) located within 10 mm of the aortorenal artery border and with a reference vessel diameter of \u003E= 4 mm and \u003C= 8 mm.  Suboptimal ptra results are defined by one or more of the following unfavorable results: \u003E= 50% residual stenosis by visual estimate, \u003E= 20 mm hg peak translesional pressure gradient, \u003E= 10 mm hg mean translesional pressure gradient, and/or grade d dissection (a spiral shaped filling defect within the lumen of the vessel) or any dissection with significant compromise in lumen flow.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
