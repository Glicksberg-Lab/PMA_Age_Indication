The system is indicated for use in patients with complex ventricular septal defects (vsd) of significant size to warrant closure who are considered to be at high risk for standard transatrial or transarterial surgical closure based on anatomical conditions and/or based on overall medical condition.  High risk anatomical factors for transatrial or transarterial surgical closure include patients:  1) requiring a left ventriculotomy or an extensive right ventriculotomy;  2) with a failed previous vsd closure;  3) with multiple apical and/or anterior muscular vsds (\"swiss cheese septum\"); or  4) with posterior apical vsds covered by trabeculae.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
