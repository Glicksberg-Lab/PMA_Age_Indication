These devices are indicated for use as follows: The ACS Multi-Link(TM) OTW, RX HP(TM), and OTW HP(TM) CSS is indicated for use in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease: due to discrete de novo native coronary artery lesions (length \u003C 20 mm) with a reference vessel diameter ranging from 3.0 mm to 3.75 mm; due to discrete restenotic native coronary artery lesions (length \u003C 20mm) with a reference vessel deameter ranging from 3.0 mm to 3.75mm; presenting with abrupt or threatened abrupt closure of native coronary arteries (lesion length \u003C 20mm) with a reference vessel diameter ranging from 3.0mm to 3.75mm); and is intended to improve coronary luminal diameter. Long term outcome (beyond six months) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.  The ACS Multi-Link(TM) RX CSS is indicated for use in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease: due to discrete de novo native coronary artery lesions (length \u003C 22mm) with a reference vessel diameter raning from 3.0mm to 3.5mm; due to discrete restenotic native coronary artery lesions (length \u003C22mm) with a reference vessel diameter raning from 3.0mm to 3.5mm; presenting with abrupt or threatened abrupt closure of native coronary arteries (lesion length \u003C32mm) with a reference vessel diameter raning from 2.5mm to 3.5mm; and is intended to improve coronary luminal diameter. Long term outcome (beyond six months) for this permanent implant is unknown at present.
