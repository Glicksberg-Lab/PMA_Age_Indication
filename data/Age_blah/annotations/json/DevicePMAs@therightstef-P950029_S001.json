The device, as modified, will be marketed under the trade name Brio and is indicated for: The generally accepted patient conditions warranting chronic cardiac pacing which include:  1) Symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent second or third-degree AV block; 2) Symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block; 3) Symptomatic paroxysmal or transient sinus node dysfunctions with or without associated AV conductions disorders; 4) Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome to prevent symptomatic bradycardia or some forms of symptomaitc tachyarrhythmias; and 5) Vaso-vagal syndrome or hypersensitive carotid sinus syndromes.  The Brio is also indicated for dual-chamber and atrial tracking modes in patients who may benefit from maintenance of AV synchrony.  Dual-chamber modes are specifically indicated for treatment of conduction disorders that require restoration of both rate and AV synchrony which include: 1) Various degrees of AV block to maintain the atrial contribution to cardiac output; and 2) VVI intolerance (e. g., pacemaker syndrome) in the presence of persistent sinus rhythm.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
