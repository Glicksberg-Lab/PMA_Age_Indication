The devices is indicted for: the architect core-m assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (cmia) for the qualitative detection of igm antibody to hepatitis b core antigen (igm anti-hbc) in human adult and pediatric serum or plasma (dipotassium edta, lithium heparin, and sodium heparin) and neonatal serum. a test for igm anti-hbc is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or recent hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in conjunction with other laboratory results and clinical information.  The architect core-m calibrators are used for the calibration of the architect i system when the system is used for the qualitative detection of igm antibody to hepatitis b core antigen (igm anti-hbc) using the architect core-m reagent kit. the performance of the architect core-m calibrators has not been established with any other igm anti-hbc assays. the architect core-m controls are used for monitoring the performance of the architect i system when used for the qualitative detection of igm antibody to hepatitis b core antigen (igm anti-hbc) in human adult serum and plasma when using the architect core-m reagent kit. the performance of the architect core-m controls has not been established with any other igm anti-hbc assays.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":410,"end":418},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":324,"end":333},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1178},"obj":"age_category"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":314,"end":319},"obj":"age_category"}]}
