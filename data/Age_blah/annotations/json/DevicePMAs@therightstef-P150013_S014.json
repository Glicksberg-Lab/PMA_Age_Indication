This is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using Monoclonal Mouse Anti-PD-L1, Clone 22C3 intended for use in the detection of PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, urothelial carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues using EnVision FLEX visualization system on Autostainer Link 48. PD-L1 protein expression in NSCLC is determined by using Tumor Proportion Score (TPS), which is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. PD-L1 protein expression in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, urothelial carcinoma and HNSCC is determined by using Combined Positive Score (CPS), which is the number of PDL1 staining cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100.Companion Diagnostic Indications Tumor Indication*\tPD-L1 Expression Level\tIntended UseNSCLC\tTPS \u003E= 1%,\tPD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying NSCLC patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). *Gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma\tCPS \u003E= 1\tPD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab).Cervical Cancer\tCPS \u003E= 1\tPD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying cervical cancer patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab).Urothelial Carcinoma\tCPS \u003E= 10\tPD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying urothelial carcinoma patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). *HNSCC\tCPS \u003E= 1\tPD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). * **See the KEYTRUDA product label for specific clinical circumstances guiding PD-L1 testing.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
