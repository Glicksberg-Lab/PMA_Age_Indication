The thermocool sf nav diagnostic/ablation deflectable tip catheter provides location information when used with compatible carto ep navigation ssytems.  The biosense webster thermocool sf diagnostic/ablation deflectable tip catheter and related accessories are indicated for use in catheter-based cardiac electrophysiological mapping (stimulating and recording) and, when used with a compatible rf generator, for the treatment of type i atrial flutter in patients age 18 or older.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications","denotations":[{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1391,"end":1396},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1387},"obj":"age_start"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1396},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":759,"end":764},"obj":"age_end"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":753,"end":764},"obj":"age_range"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":753,"end":755},"obj":"age_start"}]}
