The PathyVysion(TM) HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (PathyVysion Kit) is designed to detect amplification ofthe HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue speciments.  Results from the PathVysion Kit are intended for use as an adjuncto to existing clinical and pathologic information currently used as prognostic factors in state II, node-positive breast cancer patients.  The PathVysion Kit is further indicated as an aid in predct disease-free and overall survival in patients with stage II, node positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, dosorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) chemotherapy.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
