The device is indicated for:  insite her-2/neu mouse monoclonal antibody (clone cb11) kit is intended for in vitro diagnostic use in immunohistochem-istry (ihc) assays to semi-quantitatively localized by light microscopy the over-expression of her-2/neu (i. e., c-erbb-2) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue sections.  Insite her-2/neu is indicated as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom herceptin (trastuzumab) therapy is being considered.  Clinical interpretation of insite her-2/neu immunostaining results (absence or presence; semi-quantitative intensity score) should be complemented by appropriate controls and morphological tissue analysis and be evaluated by a qualified pathologist within the context of patient clinical history and other diagnostic results.","project":"consensus_PMA_Age_Indications"}
